W.Unu fojon, anta\\u016d longege, lo\\u011dis en bela trankvila valeto vironomita Johano, kaj sia edzino Mario. Ili estis nejunaj kaj solaj.Anta\\u016de ili havis du infanojn, kvarjaran knabeton kaj dol\\u0109an dujaranfilineton, sed ili amba\\u016d mortis. La gepatroj ofte ploregis ilin,kvankam ili estas bonaj Kristanoj, kaj neniam volis murmuri kontra\\u016dDio.Ili laboris sen\\u0109ese kaj sa\\u011de, tiel ke ilia dometo, \\u011dardeno kajkampo estis modeloj da pureco kaj beleco. Iliaj bestoj estis grasajkaj bonezorgataj.La geedzoj estis amataj de la najbaroj, por kiuj ili faris \\u0109ianeblan servon. Sed la edzino malsani\\u011dis; \\u015di ne volis konfesi siansuferon, \\u0109ar \\u015di timis tro mal\\u011dojigi sian fidelan Johanon.Li vidis nenion, \\u0109ar \\u015di adoris lin tiel, ke \\u015diaj vangoj \\u0109iamru\\u011di\\u011dis kaj \\u015diaj okuloj brili\\u011dis kiel helaj steloj, kiam ajn lirigardis \\u015din. Li ja nenion vidis; sed multaj amikoj vidis kaj koresimpatiis kun la kompatindaj geedzoj.Tiuj \\u0109i helpemaj esta\\u0135oj, la feoj, lo\\u011das en proksima arbaro, kajnokte dancadas sur la kampoj. Ili ja meritas la nomon donadatan alsia raso de la Kimraj kamparanoj. Ili vere estas \\\"la bonaj etuloj\\\";ili amas la diligenton kaj la purecon, kaj ili amegas la honestecon,la veramecon, kaj la bonkorecon.Anka\\u016d ili estas dankemaj; kaj nesciante Johano kaj Mario estisfarintaj multajn bonajn servojn je ili.Tial okazis, ke, unu matenon, kiam Mario, pala kaj laca eliris pormelki la bovinojn, \\u015di trovis ilin jam man\\u011dantajn la fre\\u015danfura\\u011don.Enirante en la laktejon, \\u015di vidis, ke tuta \\u015dia matena laboro estisbone farita. Multaj funtoj da bela flava butero staris sur grandajpladoj, la buter-lakto estis en barelo, preta por ke Johano donu \\u011dinal la porkoj man\\u011da\\u0135e, la nova lakto jam estis kribrita kaj ver\\u015ditaen purajn vazojn; anka\\u016d \\u0109iuj aliaj ujoj estis brogitaj. Enfine \\u015dinenion havis fari, krom hejti la supon kaj panetojn por matenman\\u011do.Tial \\u015di ripozis sin kaj pensis pri Johano. \\u015ci kredis, ke liestis farinta tutan \\u015dian laboron. \\u015ci \\u011duis tiun \\u0109i provon de liakonstanta amo kaj lin dankis en sia koro. Sed poste \\u015di timis, keli devis scii \\u015dian suferon, kaj \\u015di tre mal\\u011dojis.

M. P. Gambier (O. W.)Karaj gelegantoj, mi rakontis al vi la lastan fojon, historion priporkino, kiu sciis kalkuli siajn idojn. Hodia\\u016d mi parolos al vi prialia besto.Unu el miaj amikoj, pasia \\u0109asisto, havis hundinon bonan, belan kajtre fidelan.

Li ne volis reveni hejmenkaj da\\u016drigis sian vojiron \\u011dis sia kampara domo; proksime de tiudomo estas arbareto.Kiam li alvenis al la domo, li ne vidis plu sian hundinon, li \\u011dinalvokis vo\\u0109e kaj fajfe por ke \\u011di revenu, sed senutile; la hundinone revenis.Kiam eknokti\\u011dis, mia amiko revenis hejmen. Tie li informi\\u011dis prisia hundino; sed \\u011di ne estis reveninta. Kiam estis la horo porku\\u015di\\u011di, li aliris al la \\u0109evalejo, kie ordinare ku\\u015das la hundino,\\u011di ne estis ankora\\u016d reveninta.

La granda blonda, long-kapa raso de la nordo, diverse nomita_Norda_, _Skandinava_, _Te\\u016dtona_, _Germana_, and _E\\u016dropa_.(_b_). La malgranda blonda lar\\u011dkapa Fin-Ugriaraso de Norda Rusujo.(_c_). La malgranda bruna rondkapa raso de centra E\\u016dropo,etendi\\u011danta de suda Rusujo, tra la Alpujo \\u011dis la Pireneaj montoj.(_d_). La malgranda bruna long-kapa raso de Hispanujo, suda Italujo,kaj la Medeteraneaj insuloj.Tiuj \\u0109i kvar rasoj, anta\\u016d ol ili kontakti\\u011dis kune, parolis tutemalsimilajn lingvojn.Sed la tempo alvenis kiam, pro la miksi\\u011do de la rasoj, novajdialektoj deveni\\u011dis, kaj de unu el tiuj \\u0109i dialektoj naski\\u011dis lafonta-lingvo de \\u0109iuj estantaj E\\u016dropaj lingvoj (krom la Baska,Hungara, Fina kaj Turka).La regiono el kiu elmigris la Aziaj rasoj Fin-Ugria kaj CentraE\\u016dropa, estis la nordo kaj la sudo de E\\u016dropa Rusujo. Kiam tiu \\u0109iraso, migranta okcidenten renkontis la grandan blondan Nordan rason,tiu \\u0109i E\\u016dropa raso forlasis sian propran lingvon, kaj alprenis iandialekton de antikva Fina a\\u016d Ugria lingvo, samtempe kreante el \\u011dila novan Arjan dialekton la\\u016d la sama maniero per kiu, hodia\\u016d,barbaraj rasoj aliformigas kaj simpligas niajn E\\u016dropajn lingvojn.Tiu \\u0109i Arja font-lingvo ekekzistis plej kredeble en anta\\u016d-historiatempo en la lando anta\\u016de nomita la Re\\u011dlando Pola. \\u011ci disvasti\\u011disiom post iom al la okcidento al la nordo, al la sudo, kaj al laoriento. La aliaj rasoj de E\\u016dropo faris tion saman, kion estisfarinta la norda raso. Ili alprenis la dialektojn de la nove kreitaE\\u016drazia lingvo, kaj anka\\u016d, kiel la granda blonda raso de NordaE\\u016dropo, ili samtempe aliformigis \\u011din. La raso de Centra E\\u016dropoestis ne tiel malsimila al la Fina raso, de kiu unu lingvo restas\\u011dis hodia\\u016d--la Baska, kiu \\u015dajnas esti lingvo Ural-Altaika,aliformigita per kontakto en Francujo kaj Hispanujo, kun la nordaAfrika, Mediteranea raso de suda E\\u016dropo.Tiuj \\u0109i kvar grandaj rasoj de anta\\u016d-historia E\\u016dropo estas nun\\u0109ie alprenintaj dialektojn devenintajn de la Arja font-lingvo. Ennenia lando de E\\u016dropo ekzistas nun la anta\\u016da lingvo de la rasonord-Afrika-Mediteranea. Ni povas trovi iliajn parencajn lingvojnnur en Afriko, la Berbera, la Libja, kaj la antikva Egipta. La lingvode la norda raso estas tute malaperinta. Kia estis la forlasitalingvo de la granda blonda raso anta\\u016d la alpreno de la dialektoj dela Lapoj kaj Finoj, estas neeble diri, \\u0109ar nenia formo de tiu \\u0109ilingvo ekzistas, kaj la rilato de tiu \\u0109i raso al aliaj rasoj de lahomaro estas ankora\\u016d mistero.La aliformigado de la Fina-Ugria dialekto el kiu venis la Arjafont-lingvo per la miksado de la rasoj, plejkredinde okazis sur laPolaj ebenlandoj, kaj de tiu \\u0109i centro estas radiintaj \\u0109iuj_Hindaj-E\\u016dropaj_ lingvoj.

Sed miestas rapidema, tiel, se mi rikoltus nun, mi kredinde ricevosalmena\\u016d unu cent bu\\u015delojn.\\\"Gruo, kiu a\\u016ddis liajn vortojn, diris: \\\"Se mi estus vi, mi havus\\u0109iujn tri cent bu\\u015delojn tiun \\u0109i tagon mem.\\\"\\\"Kiel?\\\" diris la simplanimulo.\\\"Nu,\\\" respondis la gruo, \\\"vi provizis akvon en la akvujo por nutri larikoltojn tri monatojn. Unu monato estas pasinta, tial sufi\\u0109e daakvo por du monatoj ankora\\u016d restas en la akvujo. Se vi malfermus lapordojn de la akvujo kaj lasus flui la akvon sur la kampojn, viricevus \\u0109iujn rikoltojn tuj.\\\"\\\"\\u0108u vi estas certa, ke mi havos \\u0109iujn rikoltojn tuj?\\\" diris lasimplanimulo.\\\"Ho jes!\\\" diris la gruo, \\\"ne estas la plej malgranda dubo. Miageografia sciado estas vasta, \\u0109ar mi estas voja\\u011dinta tra grandaparto el la mondo; tial vi povas dependi de mia mondvasta scio kajsperto.\\\"La simplanimulo tiam lasis flui \\u0109iun akveron sur la kampojn. La gruoinvitis sian parencaron, kaj unue ili kune man\\u011dis \\u0109iujn grandajnfi\\u015dojn postlasitajn en la akvujo, kaj poste, flirtegante super lakampoj, ili kaptis \\u0109iujn malgrandajn fi\\u015dojn, kiuj estis elirintajkune kun la akvo. Granda parto el la rikoltoj estis forbalaita; tio,kio restis, estis balda\\u016d enfosita en la \\u015dlimo.La simplanimulo sidis sur la bordo de la lago, kaj ploris, dirante,\\\"La geografio de la gruo min ruinigis!\\\"\\\"Mia amiko,\\\" diris la gruo, \\\"mia geografio estis tiel bona kiel viaaritmetiko.\\\"\\\"_Estas tute same \\u0109u vi falas en la defluilon de tiu bordo, a\\u016d detiu \\u0109i!_\\\"LETERO EL \\u011cENEVO.Edouard Bernard.Anta\\u016d kelkaj tagoj okazis en nia urbo la Internacia FilozofiaKongreso. \\u011ci da\\u016dris kvin tagojn kaj ricevis grandan sukceson \\u0109upro la nombro de la partoprenantoj (\\u0109irka\\u016d 300) \\u0109u pro la laboroj,kiuj estas prezentitaj. Mia intenco ne estas priskribi detale \\u0109iujnkunsidojn de la kongreso. Mi volas nur doni al la legantoj de TheEsperantist kelkajn sciigojn pri la punktoj, kiuj povas ilininteresi.La problemo de la lingvo internacia okupis la lokon, kiun \\u011dimeritis. En sia parolado \\u0109e la komenco de la kongreso So. J. J.Gourd, efektiva prezidanto, aludis al tiu \\u0109i grava demando. Limemorigis, ke \\u011di jam okupis la atenton de la filozofoj \\u0109e la unuafilozofia kongreso en Parizo dum la universala Ekspozicio de 1900.Tiu unua kongreso estis elektinta Son. Couturat kiel delegito porekzameni la demandon kaj raporti al la sekvanta kongreso. So.Couturat prezentis sian raporton kaj konkludis la ali\\u011don de lakongreso al la Delegacio por la elekto de lingvo internacia. Miplezurege \\u0109eestis \\u0109e la disputado pri la raporto de So. Couturat.Tiu disputado okazis anta\\u016d multnombra publiko en la granda \\u0109ambregode la Universitato, kiun ni nomas tie \\u0109i \\\"Aula.\\\"Mi volas nur diri kelkajn vortojn pri la \\u0109arma paroladeto elparolitade So. Ernest Naville, honora prezidanto de la kongreso, unu elniaj plej rimarkindaj gloruloj. Neniu Esperantisto nescias ke So.Ernest Naville prezentis Esperanton anta\\u016d kvar jaroj \\u0109e la FrancaInstituto. Tiu respektinda filozofo, kiu havas okdek-ok jarojn, estasfervora partiano de nia kara lingvo. Pro sia granda a\\u011do li ne poviseklerni Esperanton, sed li komprenas sufi\\u0109e \\u011dian esencon por estifervora aprobanto. La granda a\\u016dtoritato, kiun \\u011duadas So. Naville,estas tre grava kaj tre precioza helpo por nia afero. Mi aldonas keli estas honora prezidanto de la Svisa Esperanta Societo, kaj kepropaganda bro\\u015duro \\u0135us estis eldonata sub liaj a\\u016dspicioj.Mi diris do, ke So. Naville faris \\u0109arman paroladeton \\u0109e lafilozofia kongreso. Li montris la gravecon de la demando de lingvointernacia kiu \\u0109iutage pligrandi\\u011das. Post ke li estis parolinta je lahistoria vidpunkto, So. E. Naville esprimis sian admiron porla mirinda verko de nia Majstro Dro.

Naville, oni parolis al mi la unuan fojon priEsperanto kaj \\u011diaj mirindaj ecoj, mi restis iom skeptika, malfidantapri la entuziasmo de miaj kunparolantoj; \\u0109ar tiuj lastaj al midiris, ke la fama filologiisto Max M\\u00fcller estis skribinta, keEsperanto estas la plej rimarkinda el \\u0109iuj artaj lingvoj, mi voliscerti\\u011di pri tio, kaj mi turnis min rekte al Max M\\u00fcller. Max M\\u00fclleral mi respondis: 'Jes, mi skribis tion.' Kaj So. Naville aldonis,ke kiam filologiisto kiel Max M\\u00fcller estis doninta sian aprobon alEsperanto, neniu havis de nun la rajton ridi.\\\" \\\"Jam,\\\" diris ankora\\u016dSo. Naville, \\\"junuloj venis peti min, por ke mi akceptu la econ dehonora prezidanto de la Svisa Esperanta Societo; mi respondis al ili,ke mi ne povas akcepti tiun titolon, tial, ke mi ne povas labori la\\u016daktiva maniero por la disvastigado por Esperanto ... sed iliinsistis; mi tiam ser\\u0109is en la Akademia vortaro kia estas la signifode la vorto 'honora' kaj mi trovis: 'honora'--tiu vorto servas pornomi la personojn kiuj portas honorantan titolon ne plenumanteoficojn.

Sec. of theLondon Esperanto Club, who invites all Esperantists to send monthlyreports of the spread of the International Language in theirdistricts. Communications must reach 14, Norfolk Street, London, W.C., before the 8th of each month.__The British Esperanto Association._The first Council of the Association took place on Monday, October24th. The President, Colonel Pollen, C.I.E., took the chair. Twelveof the Council were present, besides the executive officers. It wasdecided that the Council should use the power given them ofappointing Sub-Committees for various purposes, and to co-opt asCouncillors several people whose aid would be of value on suchSub-Committees. Messrs. Cowper, Millidge, Motteau, and Rolston, andMiss Schafer were then elected. It was decided to establish TheBritish Esperanto Association in offices at 14, Norfolk Street,Strand, and appoint an Assistant Secretary at the rate of \\u00a326 perannum. A Sub-Committee, viz., Mr. Cowper (of Deal), Mr. Maitland, andMr. Millidge, was appointed to draw up the Rules of Association, andthe Rules, when drafted, were to be submitted to the Council forapproval.It was also resolved that Dr. Lloyd, Mr. Rhodes, and Mr. Bullenshould be asked to collaborate in formulating, for submission to theCouncil, a Scheme and Rules for Examinations as to proficiency inEsperanto.A Publication Sub-Committee was also arranged.A meeting of the Executive Committee took place on November 7th, whenMiss Lawrence, the representative of the London Club, formally handedover its store of books, and goodwill, and its affiliation fees,announcing that this abdication of its prestige was made withoutasking for any _quid pro quo_, and simply as an act of loyalty to thecentral body. Miss Lawrence begged that the fact might be entered onthe minutes that the London Club had done this; and that it had bornethe heavy cost of preparing for the foundation of The BritishEsperanto Association. This was considered a reasonable request, butit was pointed out that no country Councillor was present to secondthe motion proposed by Mr. Maitland, of the West London Group. It wastherefore seconded by Mr. Gill, of the Acton Group.The Committee also decided that the election of Fellows of theAssociation must be left to the consideration of the full Council,and that no immediate action could be taken in the several caseswhere applicants had forwarded subscriptions accompanied by requeststhat the senders might be elected Fellows of the B.E.A. It might bepointed out here that, according to the draft Rules, \\\"The Councilare empowered to elect from the _Members_ a limited number ofFellows, who have proved themselves to be expert Esperantists, andwho are willing to pay 5s.\\\"It was announced with regret that W. Whitebrook, Esq., would beunable, owing to the numerous professional calls on his time, toaccept the Hon. Treasurership. The Committee expressed theirheartfelt sense of the loss this meant to the Association, andelected Harald Clegg, Esq. (the Hon. Secretary), to fill the positionof Hon. Treasurer also. All subscriptions and donations should,therefore, be addressed to Mr. Clegg, at the offices of theAssociation:--14, Norfolk Street, Strand, London, W.C._Group News._The _Acton Group_ reports a very successful meeting recently, atwhich the veteran Esperantist, Miss Warlow, was unanimously electedPresident. Miss Warlow is the first lady President of any BritishGroup. Those who know her are delighted at this fitting choice. TheHon. Secretary, Mr. E. J. Gant, Ivy Dene, Cumberland Road, Hanwell,will gladly supply information, and intending Members will beheartily welcomed. The classes are held in the South ActonSchoolrooms.From _Aberdeen_ comes the news that the Committee of the Chamber ofCommerce have unanimously agreed that if Mr. Christen desires to giveanother lecture on the subject of Esperanto, the Chamber's supportwill be given to the meeting. The Committee were glad to know thatMr. Christen \\\"was advocating the popular study of this new commerciallanguage, which had been taken up in many parts of England andScotland, and was so well known on the Continent.\\\" The Group meetingsare held in the studio of Mr. Hector, and the Hon. Secretary is Mr.Donaldson S. Rose, M.A., 259, Union Street.The _Brixton Club_ is ever energetic. It is forming a circulatinglibrary, and subscribes to five magazines. It holds its meetings onTuesdays, at 8 p.m. Members are invited to bring friends, and Mr.Eagle, 21, Kellett Road, will be pleased to give information.Canon Lonsdale has consented to become President of the _CorbridgeGroup_. The Membership is large for the size of the village, and thisis surely owing to the energetic past and present Secretaries, MissBauer and Miss Bickell.At _Battersea_, Mr. A. Lee, 2, Cupar Road, has organised a regularcampaign. The meetings are at the Latchmere Baths on Tuesday, at 7.30.The _Ilford Group_ meets at the house of Mr. Jeffrey, 42, Park Road.One of the Members of this Group learnt Esperanto so quickly thatafter 14 days he was able to write a clever historical description ofan old town.The classes at _Liverpool University_ are held on Wednesday, at 7.30,by Dr. Lloyd, who is preparing the Rules for Examinations.In _Leeds_ the classes are held at the Northern Institute on Saturdayevenings, at 8.30 p.m. The visit of Mr. Rhodes in October was muchappreciated. Between 70 and 80 people attended the lecture, manyafterwards joining the Club. To arrange for such lectures will be inthe future one of the important duties of The British EsperantoAssociation.The Rev. E. Atkins has placed a room in the Working Men's College atthe disposal of the _Leicester Group_. Mr. F. Mugglestone, 61,Bonsall Street, who is the Hon. Secretary, will gladly giveinformation._Newcastle_ does not mean to be content with one gathering. Theclasses at 29, Grainger Street, are held on Wednesdays, at 7.30, anda special elementary class for ladies at 10, Mosley Street, onWednesday evenings, from 7 until 9 o'clock.Mr. Korth, of _Swansea_, reports a rather amusing objection to theuse of the Free Library for an Esperanto class. A Committee Memberobjected because \\\"Esperanto is so awfully difficult.\\\" What kind ofstudy is favoured in Swansea if the height of difficulty is measuredby Esperanto? Inquirers will be gladly answered by Mr. Oswald Korth,1, Kensington Terrace, Swansea.Mr. S. E. Hunt, Selsley Road, Woodchester (Glos.), would like to hearfrom anyone in his neighbourhood interested in Esperanto._London Classes.__Monday._--Club Caf\\u00e9, 5, Bishopsgate Street Within. Tea at 6 o'clock;at 7 the party adjourns to 100, Gracechurch Street, to rooms kindlyplaced at their disposal by the Remington Typewriter Company._Monday._--Students' class at 7.30.

Beginners, 6.15.Advanced, 7.15._Friday_, 6.30.--Enterprise Club, Petersburgh House, LeadenhallStreet. For lady clerks and secretaries. This class is the result ofa lecture given to Members of the Club by Miss Schafer. The audiencewas much interested in the discussion as to the utility and facilityof Esperanto. Much amusement was caused when the speaker recited afew sentences in Esperanto, the meanings of which were easily guessedby the ladies present.The veteran artist, Felix Moscheles, desiring to practise speaking,would like to talk with a few Esperantists in his own beautiful home,80, Elm Park Road, Chelsea. About twilight would be a good time.The above classes are free, but, as mentioned last month, a series oflessons by a skilled Esperantist can be arranged for by applying tothe Secretary of the School of Esperanto, 93, Chancery Lane, W.C._Newspapers._The articles and letters commenced the 27th August in _La Chronique_(29, Bessborough Street, London) have continued every week since. Thearguments of M. Hamonet, our keen antagonist, may be summed up in theformula we know so well: \\\"An artificial language is so unnatural\\\";and, \\\"Esperanto, if it should be successful, will displace all thenational tongues, and Shakespeare, Goethe, Victor Hugo, Tolstoy,become just 'memories'; for boys (and men) are prone to idleness, andEsperanto is so easy that of course they will prefer it to their owntongue.\\\" Is this \\\"approval\\\" in disguise? The splendid articles in ourfavour by MM. Michaux, Bastien, Cap\\u00e9, Lef\\u00e8vre, and a member of theFrench Academy seem waste of energy after the account of hisprevisions given by our adversary, M. Hamonet; for in their wildestdreams these gentlemen never supposed that an Englishman would preferEsperanto to English.The _School World_ has at last spoken, and to some purpose. In theNovember number Mr. Mathews, of Rochester, after an exposition of thestructure and uses of Esperanto, and a comparison with Volapuk,argues that for a _large_ number of pupils in our schools the studyof Latin, French, and German has little practical value. He wouldsubstitute Esperanto for the lower forms, because (1st) more timewill be set free for other subjects; (2nd) the pupils will get a goodtraining in the correct meaning of words, and will have such acopious stock of roots that they will be able to overtake studentsin other modern languages who have not had their advantages. Heconsiders Esperanto more valuable than Latin as a means of training.An interesting article from the pen of Dr. Martyn Westcott, in theNovember number of _Womanhood_ (5, Agar Street, Strand), is the firstof a series which the Editress, Mrs. Ada Ballin, intends to carry onin future numbers. There will be a monthly lesson; also short storycompetitions, prizes, etc., etc.; and it is hoped that a _Womanhood_Club will be formed. I trust Mrs. Ballin will have great success,for, oddly enough, the majority of Esperantists are men; when oncetheir wives, sisters, and daughters take up the matter, \\\"We shall seewhat we shall see.\\\"_Foreign News._First in importance are the preparations for the Congress in Boulognenext year. Dr. Zamenhof, having consented to preside, has alsointimated his wish that this should be a Congress in which everyGroup in the world should be represented, but the Boulogne Group,unaided, could not organise so stupendous an affair; even thecomparatively small gathering at Dover last summer cost more thanthat Group could rightly afford; M. Michaux therefore calls for aidfrom all quarters. The Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Fran\\u00e7aise p.p. Esperanto has, asusual, been the first to answer. It announces a contribution of 200francs, and more, if possible. What will Great Britain do? Many havesuggested that Dr. Zamenhof should \\\"come out of his shell.\\\" Now hemeans, if possible, to do so. We must see that he has a good welcome.Will Esperantists send suggestions to the Hon. Secretary of TheBritish Esperanto Association as to how much we should contribute?There is to be a great Esperanto Exhibition in Algiers in March, andCaptain Cap\\u00e9, 17, Boulevard, Gambetta, earnestly hopes thatliterature of all kinds may be lent him. Circulars in Esperanto,articles of commerce with Esperanto labels, books, journals, postcards, propaganda leaflets, etc., etc.At the Grenoble Congress M. Bolack occupied some hours in describingthe invention, the Langue Bleue, to which he has devoted so much timeand money, but he at length confessed that he could not hold aconversation in it for even five consecutive minutes.It is stated in this month's _Esperantiste_ that, owing to a fire inhis house, Mr. Geoghegan, the first English Esperantist (it issupposed), has lost the whole of his valuable collection of letters,post cards, and books; this means that he has lost the addresses ofall his correspondents as well. Any such who read these lines areasked to send him their news to East Sound, Washington County, U.S.A.Truly every Esperantist will condole with him upon this loss.On the 19th October an amusing critique appeared in the _GlasgowEvening Times_. Under the heading of \\\"Shreds and Patches\\\" its editorattacked Esperanto in diatribe against Mr. W. T. Stead. Thisnaturally provoked the retort on the 20th that Esperanto was not anew untried experiment which Mr. Stead was trying to boom, and thatthere was no earthly reason for connecting the man and the language,except that Mr. Stead is enthusiastic and open-minded, and Esperantoas a language is approved of by such. Mr. Wallace, Mr. Buchanan, Mr.Rhodes and others joined in the fray, and on November 2nd an amusingskit headed \\\"Shredoji kaj Patchegaj\\\" appeared, in which the writerstarted by saying \\\"Mi esperas ke Mi povos uzi la Internacia LingoEsperanto por tui artikolon,\\\" but he found it better to stick toEnglish. Of the propriety of this there could be no question, seeingthe writer knew only twelve words of Esperanto. He then goes on toclassify the thirty-seven letters he had received, announcing that,evidently, \\\"any craft that appears within extreme range of Esperantomust be a hostile torpedo boat.\\\" The correspondence apparentlydwindled after this date; but one singular fact with regard to itappears to be that Glasgow people themselves were not sufficientlyinterested to enlarge the Glasgow group to any conceivable extent,the exact opposite to Aberdeen, Bedford, etc.The November number of the _Note-Book_ (every issue gives Esperantomatter) contains a very interesting report of the General Meeting ofthe British Esperanto Association, together with the usualinteresting lesson, and an account of an amusing game by Mr. Hugon.The foreign Esperanto journals have been especially interesting oflate. Many of them have contained articles on \\\"Holidays inEsperantoland.\\\" Most of the gazettes are also improving inappearance, which must also be taken as a good sign of progress andincreasing circulation.Several New Zealand papers have been discussing Esperanto of late._The Voice_, a widely-read and attractive monthly, led the way, andOtago and Southland papers have followed on, thanks to the energy ofMr. Field.OKAZETO VENEZIA.Originale verkita de D.

I had never seen mystepfather. Indeed, I never even thought of him as anything more thanColonel Watts-Morgan. I owed him nothing, except my poverty. He marriedmy dear mother when I was a girl at school in Switzerland; and heproceeded to spend her little fortune, left at her sole disposal by myfather's will, in paying his gambling debts. After that, he carried mydear mother off to Burma; and when he and the climate between them hadsucceeded in killing her, he made up for his appropriations at thecheapest rate by allowing me just enough to send me to Girton. So, whenthe Colonel died, in the year I was leaving college, I did not think itnecessary to go into mourning for him. Especially as he chose theprecise moment when my allowance was due, and bequeathed me nothing buthis consolidated liabilities.'Of course you will teach,' said Elsie Petheridge, when I explained myaffairs to her. 'There is a good demand just now for high-schoolteachers.'I looked at her, aghast. '_Teach!_ Elsie,' I cried. (I had come up totown to settle her in at her unfurnished lodgings.) 'Did you say_teach_? That's just like you dear good schoolmistresses! You go toCambridge, and get examined till the heart and life have been examinedout of you; then you say to yourselves at the end of it all, \\\"Let mesee; what am I good for now? I'm just about fit to go away and examineother people!\\\" That's what our Principal would call \\\"a viciouscircle\\\"--if one could ever admit there was anything vicious at all about_you_, dear. No, Elsie, I do _not_ propose to teach. Nature did not cutme out for a high-school teacher. I couldn't swallow a poker if I triedfor weeks. Pokers don't agree with me. Between ourselves, I am a bit ofa rebel.''You are, Brownie,' she answered, pausing in her papering, with hersleeves rolled up--they called me 'Brownie,' partly because of my darkcomplexion, but partly because they could never understand me. 'We allknew that long ago.'I laid down the paste-brush and mused.'Do you remember, Elsie,' I said, staring hard at the paper-board,' whenI first went to Girton, how all you girls wore your hair quite straight,in neat smooth coils, plaited up at the back about the size of apancake; and how of a sudden I burst in upon you, like a tropicalhurricane, and demoralised you; and how, after three days of me, some ofthe dear innocents began with awe to cut themselves artless fringes,while others went out in fear and trembling and surreptitiouslypurchased a pair of curling-tongs? I was a bomb-shell in your midst inthose days; why, you yourself were almost afraid at first to speak tome.''You see, you had a bicycle,' Elsie put in, smoothing the half-paperedwall; 'and in those days, of course, ladies didn't bicycle. You mustadmit, Brownie, dear, it _was_ a startling innovation. You terrified usso. And yet, after all, there isn't much harm in you.''I hope not,' I said devoutly. 'I was before my time, that was all; atpresent, even a curate's wife may blamelessly bicycle.''But if you don't teach,' Elsie went on, gazing at me with thosewondering big blue eyes of hers, 'whatever will you do, Brownie?' Herhorizon was bounded by the scholastic circle.'I haven't the faintest idea,' I answered, continuing to paste. 'Only,as I can't trespass upon your elegant hospitality for life, whatever Imean to do, I must begin doing this morning, when we've finished thepapering. I couldn't teach' (teaching, like mauve, is the refuge of theincompetent); 'and I don't, if possible, want to sell bonnets.''As a milliner's girl?' Elsie asked, with a face of red horror.'As a milliner's girl; why not? 'Tis an honest calling. Earls' daughtersdo it now. But you needn't look so shocked. I tell you, just at present,I am not contemplating it.''Then what _do_ you contemplate?'I paused and reflected. 'I am here in London,' I answered, gazing raptat the ceiling; 'London, whose streets are paved with gold--though it_looks_ at first sight like muddy flagstones; London, the greatest andrichest city in the world, where an adventurous soul ought surely tofind some loophole for an adventure. (That piece is hung crooked, dear;we shall have to take it down again.) I devise a Plan, therefore. Isubmit myself to fate; or, if you prefer it, I leave my future in thehands of Providence. I shall stroll out this morning, as soon as I've\\\"cleaned myself,\\\" and embrace the first stray enterprise that offers.Our Bagdad teems with enchanted carpets. Let one but float my way, and,hi, presto, I seize it. I go where glory or a modest competence waitsme. I snatch at the first offer, the first hint of an opening.'Elsie stared at me, more aghast and more puzzled than ever. 'But, how?'she asked. 'Where? When? You _are_ so strange! What will you do to findone?''Put on my hat and walk out,' I answered. 'Nothing could be simpler.This city bursts with enterprises and surprises. Strangers from east andwest hurry through it in all directions. Omnibuses traverse it from endto end--even, I am told, to Islington and Putney; within, folk sit faceto face who never saw one another before in their lives, and who maynever see one another again, or, on the contrary, may pass the rest oftheir days together.'I had a lovely harangue all pat in my head, in much the same strain, onthe infinite possibilities of entertaining angels unawares, in cabs, onthe Underground, in the a\\u00ebrated bread shops; but Elsie's widening eyesof horror pulled me up short like a hansom in Piccadilly when theinexorable upturned hand of the policeman checks it. 'Oh, Brownie,' shecried, drawing back, 'you _don't_ mean to tell me you're going to askthe first young man you meet in an omnibus to marry you?'[Illustration: I AM GOING OUT, SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE.]I shrieked with laughter, 'Elsie,' I cried, kissing her dear yellowlittle head, 'you are _impayable_. You never will learn what I mean. Youdon't understand the language. No, no; I am going out, simply in searchof adventure. What adventure may come, I have not at this moment thefaintest conception. The fun lies in the search, the uncertainty, thetoss-up of it. What is the good of being penniless--with the triflingexception of twopence--unless you are prepared to accept your positionin the spirit of a masked ball at Covent Garden?''I have never been to one,' Elsie put in.'Gracious heavens, neither have I! What on earth do you take me for? ButI mean to see where fate will lead me.''I may go with you?' Elsie pleaded.'Certainly _not_, my child,' I answered--she was three years older thanI, so I had the right to patronise her. 'That would spoil all. Your dearlittle face would be quite enough to scare away a timid adventure.' Sheknew what I meant. It was gentle and pensive, but it lacked initiative.So, when we had finished that wall, I popped on my best hat, and poppedout by myself into Kensington Gardens.I am told I ought to have been terribly alarmed at the straits in whichI found myself--a girl of twenty-one, alone in the world, and onlytwopence short of penniless, without a friend to protect, a relation tocounsel her. (I don't count Aunt Susan, who lurked in ladylike indigenceat Blackheath, and whose counsel, like her tracts, was given away tooprofusely to everybody to allow of one's placing any very high valueupon it.) But, as a matter of fact, I must admit I was not in the leastalarmed. Nature had endowed me with a profusion of crisp black hair, andplenty of high spirits. If my eyes had been like Elsie's--that liquidblue which looks out upon life with mingled pity and amazement--I mighthave felt as a girl ought to feel under such conditions; but havinglarge dark eyes, with a bit of a twinkle in them, and being as well ableto pilot a bicycle as any girl of my acquaintance, I have inherited oracquired an outlook on the world which distinctly leans rather towardscheeriness than despondency. I croak with difficulty. So I accepted myplight as an amusing experience, affording full scope for the congenialexercise of courage and ingenuity.How boundless are the opportunities of Kensington Gardens--the RoundPond, the winding Serpentine, the mysterious seclusion of the Dutchbrick Palace! Genii swarm there. One jostles possibilities. It is a landof romance, bounded on the north by the Abyss of Bayswater, and on thesouth by the Amphitheatre of the Albert Hall. But for a centre ofadventure I choose the Long Walk; it beckoned me somewhat as theNorth-West Passage beckoned my seafaring ancestors--the buccaneeringmariners of Elizabethan Devon. I sat down on a chair at the foot of anold elm with a poetic hollow, prosaically filled by a utilitarian plateof galvanised iron. Two ancient ladies were seated on the other sidealready--very grand-looking dames, with the haughty and exclusiveugliness of the English aristocracy in its later stages. For frankhideousness, commend me to the noble dowager. They were talkingconfidentially as I sat down; the trifling episode of my approach didnot suffice to stem the full stream of their conversation. The greatignore the intrusion of their inferiors.[Illustration: OUI, MADAME; MERCI BEAUCOUP, MADAME.]'Yes, it's a terrible nuisance,' the eldest and ugliest of the twoobserved--she was a high-born lady, with a distinctly cantankerous castof countenance. She had a Roman nose, and her skin was wrinkled like awilted apple; she wore coffee-coloured point-lace in her bonnet, with acomplexion to match. 'But what could I do, my dear? I simply _couldn't_put up with such insolence. So I looked her straight back in theface--oh, she quailed, I can tell you; and I said to her, in my iciestvoice--you know how icy I can be when occasion demands it'--the secondold lady nodded an ungrudging assent, as if perfectly prepared to admither friend's rare gift of iciness--'I said to her, \\\"C\\u00e9lestine, you cantake your month's wages, and half an hour to get out of this house.\\\" Andshe dropped me a deep reverence, and she answered: \\\"_Oui, madame; mercibeaucoup, madame; je ne desire pas mieux, madame._\\\" And out sheflounced. So there was the end of it.''Still, you go to Schlangenbad on Monday?''That's the point. On Monday. If it weren't for the journey, I shouldhave been glad enough to be rid of the minx. I'm glad as it is, indeed;for a more insolent, upstanding, independent, answer-you-back-againyoung woman, with a sneer of her own, _I_ never saw, Amelia--but I_must_ get to Schlangenbad. Now, there the difficulty comes in. On theone hand, if I engage a maid in London, I have the choice of two evils.Either I must take a trapesing English girl--and I know by experiencethat an English girl on the Continent is a vast deal worse than no maidat all: _you_ have to wait upon _her_, instead of her waiting upon you;she gets seasick on the crossing, and when she reaches France orGermany, she hates the meals, and she detests the hotel servants, andshe can't speak the language, so that she's always calling you in tointerpret for her in her private differences with the _fille-de-chambre_and the landlord; or else I must pick up a French maid in London, and Iknow equally by experience that the French maids one engages in Londonare invariably dishonest--more dishonest than the rest even; they'vecome here because they have no character to speak of elsewhere, and theythink you aren't likely to write and enquire of their last mistress inToulouse or St. Petersburg. Then, again, on the other hand, I can't waitto get a Gretchen, an unsophisticated little Gretchen of the Taunus atSchlangenbad-- I suppose there _are_ unsophisticated girls in Germanystill--made in Germany--they don't make 'em any longer in England, I'msure--like everything else, the trade in rustic innocence has beendriven from the country. I can't wait to get a Gretchen, as I shouldlike to do, of course, because I simply _daren't_ undertake to cross theChannel alone and go all that long journey by Ostend or Calais, Brusselsand Cologne, to Schlangenbad.''You could get a temporary maid,' her friend suggested, in a lull of thetornado.The Cantankerous Old Lady flared up. 'Yes, and have my jewel-casestolen! Or find she was an English girl without one word of German. Ornurse her on the boat when I want to give my undivided attention to myown misfortunes. No, Amelia, I call it positively unkind of you tosuggest such a thing. You're _so_ unsympathetic! I put my foot downthere. I will _not_ take any temporary person.'I saw my chance. This was a delightful idea. Why not start forSchlangenbad with the Cantankerous Old Lady?Of course, I had not the slightest intention of taking a lady's-maid'splace for a permanency. Nor even, if it comes to that, as a passingexpedient. But _if_ I wanted to go round the world, how could I dobetter than set out by the Rhine country? The Rhine leads you on to theDanube, the Danube to the Black Sea, the Black Sea to Asia; and so, byway of India, China, and Japan, you reach the Pacific and San Francisco;whence one returns quite easily by New York and the White Star Liners. Ibegan to feel like a globe-trotter already; the Cantankerous Old Ladywas the thin end of the wedge--the first rung of the ladder! I proceededto put my foot on it.[Illustration: EXCUSE ME, I SAID, BUT I THINK I SEE A WAY OUT OF YOURDIFFICULTY.]I leaned around the corner of the tree and spoke. 'Excuse me,' I said,in my suavest voice, 'but I think I see a way out of your difficulty.'My first impression was that the Cantankerous Old Lady would go off in afit of apoplexy. She grew purple in the face with indignation andastonishment, that a casual outsider should venture to address her; somuch so, indeed, that for a second I almost regretted my well-meantinterposition. Then she scanned me up and down, as if I were a girl in amantle shop, and she contemplated buying either me or the mantle. Atlast, catching my eye, she thought better of it, and burst out laughing.'What do you mean by this eavesdropping?' she asked.I flushed up in turn. 'This is a public place,' I replied, with dignity;'and you spoke in a tone which was hardly designed for the strictestprivacy. If you don't wish to be overheard, you oughtn't to shout.Besides, I desired to do you a service.'The Cantankerous Old Lady regarded me once more from head to foot. I didnot quail. Then she turned to her companion. 'The girl has spirit,' sheremarked, in an encouraging tone, as if she were discussing some absentperson. 'Upon my word, Amelia, I rather like the look of her. Well, mygood woman, what do you want to suggest to me?''Merely this,' I replied, bridling up and crushing her. 'I am a Girtongirl, an officer's daughter, no more a good woman than most others of myclass; and I have nothing in particular to do for the moment. I don'tobject to going to Schlangenbad. I would convoy you over, as companion,or lady-help, or anything else you choose to call it; I would remainwith you there for a week, till you could arrange with your Gretchen,presumably unsophisticated; and then I would leave you. Salary isunimportant; my fare suffices. I accept the chance as a cheapopportunity of attaining Schlangenbad.'The yellow-faced old lady put up her long-handled tortoise-shelleyeglasses and inspected me all over again. 'Well, I declare,' shemurmured. 'What are girls coming to, I wonder? Girton, you say; Girton!That place at Cambridge! You speak Greek, of course; but how aboutGerman?''Like a native,' I answered, with cheerful promptitude. 'I was at schoolin Canton Berne; it is a mother tongue to me.''No, no,' the old lady went on, fixing her keen small eyes on my mouth.'Those little lips could never frame themselves to \\\"schlecht\\\" or\\\"wundersch\\u00f6n\\\"; they were not cut out for it.''Pardon me,' I answered, in German. 'What I say, that I mean. Thenever-to-be-forgotten music of the Fatherland's-speech has on my infantear from the first-beginning impressed itself.'The old lady laughed aloud.'Don't jabber it to me, child,' she cried. 'I hate the lingo. It's theone tongue on earth that even a pretty girl's lips fail to renderattractive. You yourself make faces over it. What's your name, youngwoman?''Lois Cayley.''Lois! _What_ a name! I never heard of any Lois in my life before,except Timothy's grandmother. _You're_ not anybody's grandmother, areyou?''Not to my knowledge,' I answered, gravely.She burst out laughing again.'Well, you'll do, I think,' she said, catching my arm. 'That big milldown yonder hasn't ground the originality altogether out of you. I adoreoriginality. It was clever of you to catch at the suggestion of thisarrangement. Lois Cayley, you say; any relation of a madcap CaptainCayley whom I used once to know, in the Forty-second Highlanders?''His daughter,' I answered, flushing. For I was proud of my father.'Ha! I remember; he died, poor fellow; he was a good soldier--andhis'--I felt she was going to say 'his fool of a widow,' but a glancefrom me quelled her; 'his widow went and married that good-lookingscapegrace, Jack Watts-Morgan. Never marry a man, my dear, with adouble-barrelled name and no visible means of subsistence; above all, ifhe's generally known by a nickname. So you're poor Tom Cayley'sdaughter, are you? Well, well, we can settle this little matter betweenus. Mind, I'm a person who always expects to have my own way. If youcome with _me_ to Schlangenbad, you must do as I tell you.''I _think_ I could manage it--for a week,' I answered, demurely.She smiled at my audacity. We passed on to terms. They were quitesatisfactory. She wanted no references. 'Do I look like a woman whocares about a reference? What are called _characters_ are usually essaysin how not to say it. You take my fancy; that's the point! And poor TomCayley! But, mind, I will _not_ be contradicted.''I will not contradict your wildest misstatement,' I answered, smiling.'_And_ your name and address?' I asked, after we had settledpreliminaries.A faint red spot rose quaintly in the centre of the Cantankerous OldLady's sallow cheek. 'My dear,' she murmured, 'my name is the one thingon earth I'm really ashamed of. My parents chose to inflict upon me themost odious label that human ingenuity ever devised for a Christiansoul; and I've not had courage enough to burst out and change it.'A gleam of intuition flashed across me, 'You don't mean to say,' Iexclaimed, 'that you're called Georgina?'The Cantankerous Old Lady gripped my arm hard. 'What an unusuallyintelligent girl!' she broke in. 'How on earth did you guess? It _is_Georgina.''Fellow-feeling,' I answered. 'So is mine, Georgina Lois. But as I quiteagree with you as to the atrocity of such conduct, I have suppressed theGeorgina. It ought to be made penal to send innocent girls into theworld so burdened.''My opinion to a T! You are really an exceptionally sensible youngwoman. There's my name and address; I start on Monday.'I glanced at her card. The very copperplate was noisy. 'Lady GeorginaFawley, 49 Fortescue Crescent, W.'It had taken us twenty minutes to arrange our protocols. As I walkedoff, well pleased, Lady Georgina's friend ran after me quickly.'You must take care,' she said, in a warning voice. 'You've caught aTartar.''So I suspect,' I answered. 'But a week in Tartary will be at least anexperience.''She has an awful temper.''That's nothing. So have I. Appalling, I assure you. And if it comes toblows, I'm bigger and younger and stronger than she is.''Well, I wish you well out of it.''Thank you. It is kind of you to give me this warning. But I think I cantake care of myself. I come, you see, of a military family.'I nodded my thanks, and strolled back to Elsie's. Dear little Elsie wasin transports of surprise when I related my adventure.'Will you really go? And what will you do, my dear, when you get there?''I haven't a notion,' I answered; 'that's where the fun comes in. But,anyhow, I shall have got there.''Oh, Brownie, you might starve!''And I might starve in London. In either place, I have only two handsand one head to help me.''But, then, here you are among friends. You might stop with me forever.'I kissed her fluffy forehead. 'You good, generous little Elsie,' Icried; 'I won't stop here one moment after I have finished the paintingand papering. I came here to help you. I couldn't go on eating yourhard-earned bread and doing nothing. I know how sweet you are; but thelast thing I want is to add to your burdens. Now let us roll up oursleeves again and hurry on with the dado.''But, Brownie, you'll want to be getting your own things ready.Remember, you're off to Germany on Monday.'I shrugged my shoulders. 'Tis a foreign trick I picked up inSwitzerland. 'What have I got to get ready?' I asked. 'I can't go outand buy a complete summer outfit in Bond Street for twopence. Now, don'tlook at me like that: be practical, Elsie, and let me help you paint thedado.' For unless I helped her, poor Elsie could never have finished itherself. I cut out half her clothes for her; her own ideas were almostentirely limited to differential calculus. And cutting out a blouse bydifferential calculus is weary, uphill work for a high-school teacher.By Monday I had papered and furnished the rooms, and was ready to starton my voyage of exploration. I met the Cantankerous Old Lady at CharingCross, by appointment, and proceeded to take charge of her luggage andtickets.Oh my, how fussy she was! 'You will drop that basket! I hope you havegot through tickets, _vi\\u00e2_ Malines, _not_ by Brussels-- I won't go byBrussels. You have to change there. Now, mind you notice how much theluggage weighs in English pounds, and make the man at the office giveyou a note of it to check those horrid Belgian porters. They'll chargeyou for double the weight, unless you reduce it at once to kilogrammes._I_ know their ways. Foreigners have no consciences. They just go to thepriest and confess, you know, and wipe it all out, and start fresh againon a career of crime next morning. I'm sure I don't know why I _ever_ goabroad. The only country in the world fit to live in is England. Nomosquitoes, no passports, no--goodness gracious, child, don't let thatodious man bang about my hat-box! Have you no immortal soul, porter,that you crush other people's property as if it was blackbeetles? No, Iwill not let you take this, Lois; this is my jewel-box--it contains allthat remains of the Fawley family jewels. I positively decline to appearat Schlangenbad without a diamond to my back. This never leaves myhands. It's hard enough nowadays to keep body and skirt together. _Have_you secured that _coup\\u00e9_ at Ostend?'[Illustration: A MOST URBANE AND OBLIGING CONTINENTAL GENTLEMAN.]We got into our first-class carriage. It was clean and comfortable; butthe Cantankerous Old Lady made the porter mop the floor, and fidgetedand worried till we slid out of the station. Fortunately, the only otheroccupant of the compartment was a most urbane and obliging Continentalgentleman--I say Continental, because I couldn't quite make out whetherhe was French, German, or Austrian--who was anxious in every way to meetLady Georgina's wishes. Did madame desire to have the window open? Oh,certainly, with pleasure; the day was so sultry. Closed a little more?_Parfaitement_, there _was_ a current of air, _il faut l'admettre_.Madame would prefer the corner? No? Then perhaps she would like thisvalise for a footstool? _Permettez_--just thus. A cold draught runs sooften along the floor in railway carriages. This is Kent that wetraverse; ah, the garden of England! As a diplomat, he knew every nookof Europe, and he echoed the _mot_ he had accidentally heard drop frommadame's lips on the platform: no country in the world so delightful asEngland!'Monsieur is attached to the Embassy in London?' Lady Georgina inquired,growing affable.He twirled his grey moustache: a waxed moustache of great distinction.'No, madame; I have quitted the diplomatic service; I inhabit London now_pour mon agr\\u00e9ment_. Some of my compatriots call it _triste_; for me, Ifind it the most fascinating capital in Europe. What gaiety! Whatmovement! What poetry! What mystery!''If mystery means fog, it challenges the world,' I interposed.He gazed at me with fixed eyes. 'Yes, mademoiselle,' he answered, inquite a different and markedly chilly voice. 'Whatever your greatcountry attempts--were it only a fog--it achieves consummately.'I have quick intuitions. I felt the foreign gentleman took aninstinctive dislike to me.To make up for it, he talked much, and with animation, to Lady Georgina.They ferreted out friends in common, and were as much surprised at it aspeople always are at that inevitable experience.'Ah yes, madame, I recollect him well in Vienna. I was there at thetime, attached to our Legation. He was a charming man; you read hismasterly paper on the Central Problem of the Dual Empire?''You were in Vienna then!' the Cantankerous Old Lady mused back. 'Lois,my child, don't stare'--she had covenanted from the first to call meLois, as my father's daughter, and I confess I preferred it to beingMiss Cayley'd. 'We must surely have met. Dare I ask your name,monsieur?'I could see the foreign gentleman was delighted at this turn. He hadplayed for it, and carried his point. He meant her to ask him. He had acard in his pocket, conveniently close; and he handed it across to her.She read it, and passed it on: 'M. le Comte de Laroche-sur-Loiret.''Oh, I remember your name well,' the Cantankerous Old Lady broke in. 'Ithink you knew my husband, Sir Evelyn Fawley, and my father, LordKynaston.'The Count looked profoundly surprised and delighted. 'What! you are thenLady Georgina Fawley!' he cried, striking an attitude. 'Indeed, miladi,your admirable husband was one of the very first to exert his influencein my favour at Vienna. Do I recall him, _ce cher_ Sir Evelyn? If Irecall him! What a fortunate rencounter! I must have seen you some yearsago at Vienna, miladi, though I had not then the great pleasure ofmaking your acquaintance. But your face had impressed itself on mysub-conscious self!' (I did not learn till later that the esotericdoctrine of the sub-conscious self was Lady Georgina's favourite hobby.)'The moment chance led me to this carriage this morning, I said tomyself, \\\"That face, those features: so vivid, so striking: I have seenthem somewhere. With what do I connect them in the recesses of mymemory? A high-born family; genius; rank; the diplomatic service; someunnameable charm; some faint touch of eccentricity. Ha! I have it.Vienna, a carriage with footmen in red livery, a noble presence, a crowdof wits--poets, artists, politicians--pressing eagerly round thelandau.\\\" That was my mental picture as I sat and confronted you: Iunderstand it all now; this is Lady Georgina Fawley!'I thought the Cantankerous Old Lady, who was a shrewd person in her way,must surely see through this obvious patter; but I had under-estimatedthe average human capacity for swallowing flattery. Instead ofdismissing his fulsome nonsense with a contemptuous smile, LadyGeorgina perked herself up with a conscious air of coquetry, and askedfor more. 'Yes, they were delightful days in Vienna,' she said,simpering; 'I was young then, Count; I enjoyed life with a zest.'[Illustration: PERSONS OF MILADI'S TEMPERAMENT ARE ALWAYS YOUNG.]'Persons of miladi's temperament are always young,' the Count retorted,glibly, leaning forward and gazing at her. 'Growing old is a foolishhabit of the stupid and the vacant. Men and women of _esprit_ are neverolder. One learns as one goes on in life to admire, not the obviousbeauty of mere youth and health'--he glanced across at medisdainfully--'but the profounder beauty of deep character in aface--that calm and serene beauty which is imprinted on the brow byexperience of the emotions.''I have had my moments,' Lady Georgina murmured, with her head on oneside.'I believe it, miladi,' the Count answered, and ogled her.Thenceforward to Dover, they talked together with ceaseless animation.The Cantankerous Old Lady was capital company. She had a tang in hertongue, and in the course of ninety minutes she had flayed alive thegreater part of London society, with keen wit and sprightliness. Ilaughed against my will at her ill-tempered sallies; they were too funnynot to amuse, in spite of their vitriol. As for the Count, he wascharmed. He talked well himself, too, and between them I almost forgotthe time till we arrived at Dover.It was a very rough passage. The Count helped us to carry our nineteenhand-packages and four rugs on board; but I noticed that, fascinated asshe was with him, Lady Georgina resisted his ingenious efforts to gainpossession of her precious jewel-case as she descended the gangway. Sheclung to it like grim death, even in the chops of the Channel.Fortunately I am a good sailor, and when Lady Georgina's sallow cheeksbegan to grow pale, I was steady enough to supply her with her shawl andher smelling-bottle. She fidgeted and worried the whole way over. She_would_ be treated like a vertebrate animal. Those horrid Belgians hadno right to stick their deck-chairs just in front of her. Theimpertinence of the hussies with the bright red hair--a grocer'sdaughters, she felt sure--in venturing to come and sit on the same benchwith _her_--the bench 'for ladies only,' under the lee of the funnel!'Ladies only,' indeed! Did the baggages pretend they consideredthemselves ladies? Oh, that placid old gentleman in the episcopalgaiters was their father, was he? Well, a bishop should bring up hisdaughters better, having his children in subjection with all gravity.Instead of which--'Lois, my smelling-salts!' This was a beastly boat;such an odour of machinery; they had no decent boats nowadays; with allour boasted improvements, she could remember well when the cross-Channelservice was much better conducted than it was at present. But _that_ wasbefore we had compulsory education. The working classes were drivingtrade out of the country, and the consequence was, we couldn't build aboat which didn't reek like an oil-shop. Even the sailors on board wereFrench--jabbering idiots; not an honest British Jack-tar among the lotof them; though the stewards were English, and very inferior CockneyEnglish at that, with their off-hand ways, and their School Board airsand graces. _She'd_ School Board them if they were her servants; _she'd_show them the sort of respect that was due to people of birth andeducation. But the children of the lower classes never learnt theircatechism nowadays; they were too much occupied with literatoor,jography, and free-'and drawrin'. Happily for my nerves, a good lurch toleeward put a stop for a while to the course of her thoughts on thepresent distresses.At Ostend the Count made a second gallant attempt to capture thejewel-case, which Lady Georgina automatically repulsed. She had a fixedhabit, I believe, of sticking fast to that jewel-case; for she was toooverpowered by the Count's urbanity, I feel sure, to suspect for amoment his honesty of purpose. But whenever she travelled, I fancy, sheclung to her case as if her life depended upon it; it contained thewhole of her valuable diamonds.We had twenty minutes for refreshments at Ostend, during which intervalmy old lady declared with warmth that I _must_ look after her registeredluggage; though, as it was booked through to Cologne, I could not evensee it till we crossed the German frontier; for the Belgian _douaniers_seal up the van as soon as the through baggage for Germany is unloaded.To satisfy her, however, I went through the formality of pretending toinspect it, and rendered myself hateful to the head of the _douane_ byasking various foolish and inept questions, on which Lady Georginainsisted. When I had finished this silly and uncongenial task--for I amnot by nature fussy, and it is hard to assume fussiness as anotherperson's proxy--I returned to our _coup\\u00e9_ which I had arranged for inLondon. To my great amazement, I found the Cantankerous Old Lady and theegregious Count comfortably seated there. 'Monsieur has been good enoughto accept a place in our carriage,' she observed, as I entered.He bowed and smiled. 'Or, rather, madame has been so kind as to offer meone,' he corrected.'Would you like some lunch, Lady Georgina?' I asked, in my chilliestvoice. 'There are ten minutes to spare, and the _buffet_ is excellent.''An admirable inspiration,' the Count murmured. 'Permit me to escortyou, miladi.''You will come, Lois?' Lady Georgina asked.'No, thank you,' I answered, for I had an idea. 'I am a capital sailor,but the sea takes away my appetite.''Then you'll keep our places,' she said, turning to me. 'I hope youwon't allow them to stick in any horrid foreigners! They will try toforce them on you unless you insist. _I_ know their tricky ways. Youhave the tickets, I trust? And the _bulletin_ for the _coup\\u00e9_? Well,mind you don't lose the paper for the registered luggage. Don't letthose dreadful porters touch my cloaks. And if anybody attempts to getin, be sure you stand in front of the door as they mount to preventthem.'The Count handed her out; he was all high courtly politeness. As LadyGeorgina descended, he made yet another dexterous effort to relieve herof the jewel-case. I don't think she noticed it, but automatically oncemore she waved him aside. Then she turned to me. 'Here, my dear,' shesaid, handing it to me, 'you'd better take care of it. If I lay it downin the _buffet_ while I am eating my soup, some rogue may run away withit. But mind, don't let it out of your hands on any account. Hold itso, on your knee; and, for Heaven's sake, don't part with it.'[Illustration: THAT SUCCEEDS? THE SHABBY-LOOKING MAN MUTTERED.]By this time my suspicions of the Count were profound. From the first Ihad doubted him; he was so blandly plausible. But as we landed at OstendI had accidentally overheard a low whispered conversation when he passeda shabby-looking man, who had travelled in a second-class carriage fromLondon. 'That succeeds?' the shabby-looking man had muttered under hisbreath in French, as the haughty nobleman with the waxed moustachebrushed by him.'That succeeds admirably,' the Count had answered, in the same softundertone. '_\\u00c7a r\\u00e9ussit \\u00e0 merveille!_'I understood him to mean that he had prospered in his attempt to imposeon Lady Georgina.They had been gone five minutes at the _buffet_, when the Count cameback hurriedly to the door of the _coup\\u00e9_ with a _nonchalant_ air. 'Oh,mademoiselle,' he said, in an off-hand tone, 'Lady Georgina has sent meto fetch her jewel-case.'I gripped it hard with both hands. '_Pardon_, M. le Comte,' I answered;'Lady Georgina intrusted it to _my_ safe keeping, and, without herleave, I cannot give it up to any one.''You mistrust me?' he cried, looking black. 'You doubt my honour? Youdoubt my word when I say that miladi has sent me?''_Du tout_,' I answered, calmly. 'But I have Lady Georgina's orders tostick to this case; and till Lady Georgina returns I stick to it.'He murmured some indignant remark below his breath, and walked off. Theshabby-looking passenger was pacing up and down the platform outside ina badly-made dust-coat. As they passed their lips moved. The Count'sseemed to mutter, '_C'est un coup manqu\\u00e9._'However, he did not desist even so. I saw he meant to go on with hisdangerous little game. He returned to the _buffet_ and rejoined LadyGeorgina. I felt sure it would be useless to warn her, so completely hadthe Count succeeded in gulling her; but I took my own steps. I examinedthe jewel-case closely. It had a leather outer covering; within was astrong steel box, with stout bands of metal to bind it. I took my cue atonce, and acted for the best on my own responsibility.When Lady Georgina and the Count returned, they were like old friendstogether. The quails in aspic and the sparkling hock had evidentlyopened their hearts to one another. As far as Malines they laughed andtalked without ceasing. Lady Georgina was now in her finest vein ofspleen: her acid wit grew sharper and more caustic each moment. Not areputation in Europe had a rag left to cover it as we steamed in beneaththe huge iron roof of the main central junction.I had observed all the way from Ostend that the Count had been anxiouslest we might have to give up our _coup\\u00e9_ at Malines. I assured him morethan once that his fears were groundless, for I had arranged at CharingCross that it should run right through to the German frontier. But hewaved me aside, with one lordly hand. I had not told Lady Georgina ofhis vain attempt to take possession of her jewel-case; and the bare factof my silence made him increasingly suspicious of me.'Pardon me, mademoiselle,' he said, coldly; 'you do not understand theselines as well as I do. Nothing is more common than for those rascals ofrailway clerks to sell one a place in a _coup\\u00e9_ or a _wagon-lit_, andthen never reserve it, or turn one out half way. It is very possiblemiladi may have to descend at Malines.'Lady Georgina bore him out by a large variety of selected storiesconcerning the various atrocities of the rival companies which hadstolen her luggage on her way to Italy. As for _trains de luxe_, theywere dens of robbers.So when we reached Malines, just to satisfy Lady Georgina, I put out myhead and inquired of a porter. As I anticipated, he replied that therewas no change; we went through to Verviers.The Count, however, was still unsatisfied. He descended, and made someremarks a little farther down the platform to an official in thegold-banded cap of a _chef-de-gare_, or some such functionary. Then hereturned to us, all fuming. 'It is as I said,' he exclaimed, flingingopen the door. 'These rogues have deceived us. The _coup\\u00e9_ goes nofarther. You must dismount at once, miladi, and take the train justopposite.'I felt sure he was wrong, and I ventured to say so. But Lady Georginacried, 'Nonsense, child! The _chef-de-gare_ must know. Get out at once!Bring my bag and the rugs! Mind that cloak! Don't forget thesandwich-tin! Thanks, Count; will you kindly take charge of myumbrellas? Hurry up, Lois; hurry up! the train is just starting!'I scrambled after her, with my fourteen bundles, keeping a quiet eyemeanwhile on the jewel-case.We took our seats in the opposite train, which I noticed was marked'Amsterdam, Bruxelles, Paris.' But I said nothing. The Count jumped in,jumped about, arranged our parcels, jumped out again. He spoke to aporter; then he rushed back excitedly. '_Mille pardons_, miladi,' hecried. 'I find the _chef-de-gare_ has cruelly deceived me. You wereright, after all, mademoiselle! We must return to the coup\\u00e9__!'With singular magnanimity, I refrained from saying, 'I told you so.'Lady Georgina, very flustered and hot by this time, tumbled out oncemore, and bolted back to the _coup\\u00e9_. Both trains were just starting. Inher hurry, at last, she let the Count take possession of her jewel-case.I rather fancy that as he passed one window he handed it in to theshabby-looking passenger; but I am not certain. At any rate, when wewere comfortably seated in our own compartment once more, and he stoodon the footboard just about to enter, of a sudden he made an unexpecteddash back, and flung himself wildly into a Paris carriage. At theself-same moment, with a piercing shriek, both trains started.Lady Georgina threw up her hands in a frenzy of horror. 'My diamonds!'she cried aloud. 'Oh, Lois, my diamonds!''Don't distress yourself,' I answered, holding her back, for I verilybelieve she would have leapt from the train. 'He has only taken theouter shell, with the sandwich-case inside it. _Here_ is the steel box!'And I produced it, triumphantly.She seized it, overjoyed. 'How did this happen?' she cried, hugging it,for she loved those diamonds.'Very simply,' I answered. 'I saw the man was a rogue, and that he had aconfederate with him in another carriage. So, while you were gone to the_buffet_ at Ostend, I slipped the box out of the case, and put in thesandwich-tin, that he might carry it off, and we might have proofsagainst him. All you have to do now is to inform the conductor, who willtelegraph to stop the train to Paris. I spoke to him about that atOstend, so that everything is ready.'She positively hugged me. 'My dear,' she cried, 'you are the cleverestlittle woman I ever met in my life! Who on earth could have suspectedsuch a polished gentleman? Why, you're worth your weight in gold. Whatthe dickens shall I do without you at Schlangenbad?'IITHE ADVENTURE OF THE SUPERCILIOUS _ATTACH\\u00c9_The Count must have been an adept in the gentle art of quick-changedisguise; for though we telegraphed full particulars of his appearancefrom Louvain, the next station, nobody in the least resembling eitherhim or his accomplice, the shabby-looking man, could be unearthed in theParis train when it drew up at Brussels, its first stopping-place. Theymust have transformed themselves meanwhile into two different persons.Indeed, from the outset, I had suspected his moustache--'twas so _very_distinguished.When we reached Cologne, the Cantankerous Old Lady overwhelmed me withthe warmth of her thanks and praises. Nay, more; after breakfast nextmorning, before we set out by slow train for Schlangenbad, she burstlike a tornado into my bedroom at the Cologne hotel with a cheque fortwenty guineas, drawn in my favour. 'That's for you, my dear,' she said,handing it to me, and looking really quite gracious.I glanced at the piece of paper and felt my face glow crimson. 'Oh, LadyGeorgina,' I cried; 'you misunderstand. You forget that I am a lady.''Nonsense, child, nonsense! Your courage and promptitude were worth tentimes that sum,' she exclaimed, positively slipping her arm round myneck. 'It was your courage I particularly admired, Lois; because youfaced the risk of my happening to look inside the outer case, andfinding you had abstracted the blessed box: in which case I might quitenaturally have concluded you meant to steal it.''I thought of that,' I answered. 'But I decided to risk it. I felt itwas worth while. For I was sure the man meant to take the case as soonas ever you gave him the opportunity.''Then you deserve to be rewarded,' she insisted, pressing the chequeupon me.[Illustration: I PUT HER HAND BACK FIRMLY.]I put her hand back firmly. 'Lady Georgina,' I said, 'it is very amiableof you. I think you do right in offering me the money; but I think Ishould do altogether wrong in accepting it. A lady is not honest fromthe hope of gain; she is not brave because she expects to be paid forher bravery. You were my employer, and I was bound to serve myemployer's interests. I did so as well as I could, and there is the endof it.'She looked absolutely disappointed; we all hate to crush a benevolentimpulse; but she tore the cheque up into very small pieces. 'As youwill, my dear,' she said, with her hands on her hips: 'I see, you arepoor Tom Cayley's daughter. He was always a bit Quixotic.' Though Ibelieve she liked me all the better for my refusal.On the way from Cologne to Eltville, however, and on the drive up toSchlangenbad, I found her just as fussy and as worrying as ever. 'Let mesee, how many of these horrid pfennigs make an English penny? I never_can_ remember. Oh, those silly little nickel things are ten pfennigseach, are they? Well, eight would be a penny, I suppose. A mark's ashilling; ridiculous of them to divide it into ten pence instead oftwelve; one never really knows how much one's paying for anything. Whythese Continental people can't be content to use pounds, shillings, andpence, all over alike, the same as we do, passes _my_ comprehension.They're glad enough to get English sovereigns when they can; why, then,don't they use them as such, instead of reckoning them each attwenty-five francs, and then trying to cheat you out of the properexchange, which is _always_ ten centimes more than the brokers give you?What, _we_ use their beastly decimal system? Lois, I'm ashamed of you.An English girl to turn and rend her native country like that! Francsand centimes, indeed! Fancy proposing it at Peter Robinson's! No, Iwill _not_ go by the boat, my dear. I hate the Rhine boats, crowded withnasty selfish pigs of Germans. What _I_ like is a first-classcompartment all to myself, and no horrid foreigners. Especially Germans.They're bursting with self-satisfaction--have such an exaggerated beliefin their \\\"land\\\" and their \\\"folk.\\\" And when they come to England, they donothing but find fault with us. If people aren't satisfied with thecountries they travel in, they'd better stop at home--that's _my_opinion. Nasty pigs of Germans! The very sight of them sickens me. Oh, Idon't mind if they _do_ understand me, child. They all learn Englishnowadays; it helps them in trade--that's why they're driving us out ofall the markets. But it _must_ be good for them to learn once in a waywhat other people really think of them--civilised people, I mean; notGermans. They're a set of barbarians.'We reached Schlangenbad alive, though I sometimes doubted it: for my oldlady did her boisterous best to rouse some peppery German officer intocutting our throats incontinently by the way; and when we got there, wetook up our abode in the nicest hotel in the village. Lady Georgina hadengaged the best front room on the first floor, with a charming viewacross the pine-clad valley; but I must do her the justice to say thatshe took the second best for me, and that she treated me in every waylike the guest she delighted to honour. My refusal to accept her twentyguineas made her anxious to pay it back to me within the terms of ouragreement. She described me to everybody as a young friend who wastravelling with her, and never gave any one the slightest hint of mybeing a paid companion. Our arrangement was that I was to have twoguineas for the week, besides my travelling expenses, board, andlodging.On our first morning at Schlangenbad, Lady Georgina sallied forth, verymuch overdressed, and in a youthful hat, to use the waters. They arevalued chiefly for the complexion, I learned; I wondered then why LadyGeorgina came there--for she hadn't any; but they are also recommendedfor nervous irritability, and as Lady Georgina had visited the placealmost every summer for fifteen years, it opened before one's mind anappalling vista of what her temper might have been if she had _not_ goneto Schlangenbad. The hot springs are used in the form of a bath. '_You_don't need them, my dear,' Lady Georgina said to me, with agood-humoured smile; and I will own that I did not, for nature hasgifted me with a tolerable cuticle. But I like when at Rome to do asRome does; so I tried the baths once. I found them unpleasantly smoothand oily. I do not freckle, but if I did, I think I should preferfreckles.We walked much on the terrace--the inevitable dawdling promenade of allGerman watering-places--it reeked of Serene Highness. We also drove outamong the low wooded hills which bound the Rhine valley. The majority ofthe visitors, I found, were ladies--Court ladies, most of them; allthere for their complexions, but all anxious to assure me privately theyhad come for what they described as 'nervous debility.' I divided themat once into two classes: half of them never had and never would have acomplexion at all; the other half had exceptionally smooth and beautifulskins, of which they were obviously proud, and whose pink-and-whitepeach-blossom they thought to preserve by assiduous bathing. It wasvanity working on two opposite bases. There was a sprinkling of men,however, who were really there for a sufficient reason--wounds orserious complaints; while a few good old sticks, porty and whisty, werein attendance on invalid wives or sisters.[Illustration: HE CAST A HASTY GLANCE AT US.]From the beginning I noticed that Lady Georgina went peering about allover the place, as if she were hunting for something she had lost, withher long-handled tortoise-shell glasses perpetually in evidence--the'aristocratic outrage' I called them--and that she eyed all the men withpeculiar attention. But I took no open notice of her little weakness. Onour second day at the Spa, I was sauntering with her down the chiefstreet--'a beastly little hole, my dear; not a decent shop where one canbuy a reel of thread or a yard of tape in the place!'--when I observed atall and handsome young man on the opposite side of the road cast ahasty glance at us, and then sneak round the corner hurriedly. He was aloose-limbed, languid-looking young man, with large, dreamy eyes, and apeculiarly beautiful and gentle expression; but what I noted about himmost was an odd superficial air of superciliousness. He seemed always tobe looking down with scorn on that foolish jumble, the universe. Hedarted away so rapidly, however, that I hardly discovered all this justthen. I piece it out from subsequent observations.Later in the day, we chanced to pass a _caf\\u00e9_, where three youngexquisites sat sipping Rhine wines after the fashion of the country. Oneof them, with a gold-tipped cigarette held gracefully between twoslender fingers, was my languid-looking young aristocrat. He was blowingout smoke in a lazy blue stream. The moment he saw me, however, heturned away as if he desired to escape observation, and ducked down soas to hide his face behind his companions. I wondered why on earth heshould want to avoid me. Could this be the Count? No, the young man withthe halo of cigarette smoke stood three inches taller. Who, then, atSchlangenbad could wish to avoid my notice? It was a singular mystery;for I was quite certain the supercilious young man was trying his bestto prevent my seeing him.That evening, after dinner, the Cantankerous Old Lady burst outsuddenly, 'Well, I can't for the life of me imagine why Harold hasn'tturned up here. The wretch knew I was coming; and I heard from ourAmbassador at Rome last week that he was going to be at Schlangenbad.''Who is Harold?' I asked.'My nephew,' Lady Georgina snapped back, beating a devil's tattoo withher fan on the table. 'The only member of my family, except myself, whoisn't a born idiot. Harold's not an idiot; he's an _attach\\u00e9_ at Rome.'I saw it at a glance. 'Then he _is_ in Schlangenbad,' I answered. 'Inoticed him this morning.'The old lady turned towards me sharply. She peered right through me, asif she were a R\\u00f6ntgen ray. I could see she was asking herself whetherthis was a conspiracy, and whether I had come there on purpose to meet'Harold.' But I flatter myself I am tolerably mistress of my owncountenance. I did not blench. 'How do you know?' she asked quickly,with an acid intonation.If I had answered the truth, I should have said, 'I know he is here,because I saw a good-looking young man evidently trying to avoid youthis morning; and if a young man has the misfortune to be born yournephew, and also to have expectations from you, it is easy to understandthat he would prefer to keep out of your way as long as possible.' Butthat would have been neither polite nor politic. Moreover, I reflectedthat I had no particular reason for wishing to do Mr. Harold a bad turn;and that it would be kinder to him, as well as to her, to conceal thereasons on which I based my instinctive inference. So I took up a strongstrategic position. 'I have an intuition that I saw him in the villagethis morning,' I said. 'Family likeness, perhaps. I merely jumped at itas you spoke. A tall, languid young man; large, poetical eyes; anartistic moustache--just a trifle Oriental-looking.''That's Harold!' the Cantankerous Old Lady rapped out sharply, withclear conviction. 'The miserable boy! Why on earth hasn't he been roundto see me?'I reflected that I knew why; but I did not say so. Silence is golden. Ialso remarked mentally on that curious human blindness which had made meconclude at first that the supercilious young man was trying to avoid_me_, when I might have guessed it was far more likely he was trying toavoid my companion. I was a nobody; Lady Georgina Fawley was a woman ofEuropean reputation.'Perhaps he didn't know which hotel you were stopping at,' I put in. 'Oreven that you were here.' I felt a sudden desire to shield poor Harold.'Not know which hotel? Nonsense, child; he knows I come here on thisprecise date regularly every summer; and if he didn't know, is it likelyI should try any other inn, when this is the only moderately decenthouse to stop at in Schlangenbad? And the morning coffee undrinkable atthat; while the hash--_such_ hash! But that's the way in Germany. He'san ungrateful monster; if he comes now, I shall refuse to see him.'[Illustration: HAROLD, YOU VIPER, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY TRYING TO AVOIDME?]Next morning after breakfast, however, in spite of these threats, shehailed me forth with her on the Harold hunt. She had sent the_concierge_ to inquire at all the hotels already, it seemed, and foundher truant at none of them; now she ransacked the _pensions_. At lastshe hunted him down in a house on the hill. I could see she was reallyhurt. 'Harold, you viper, what do you mean by trying to avoid me?''My dear aunt, _you_ here in Schlangenbad! Why, when did you arrive? Andwhat a colour you've got! You're looking _so_ well!' That clever thrustsaved him.He cast me an appealing glance. 'You will not betray me?' it said. Ianswered, mutely, 'Not for worlds,' with a faltering pair of downcasteyelids.'Oh, I'm _well_ enough, thank you,' Lady Georgina replied, somewhatmollified by his astute allusion to her personal appearance. He had hither weak point dexterously. 'As well, that is, as one can expect to benowadays. Hereditary gout--the sins of the fathers visited as usual. Butwhy didn't you come to see me?''How can I come to see you if you don't tell me where you are? \\\"LadyGeorgina Fawley, Europe,\\\" was the only address I knew. It strikes me asinsufficient.'His gentle drawl was a capital foil to Lady Georgina's aciduloussoprano. It seemed to disarm her. She turned to me with a benignant waveof her hand. 'Miss Cayley,' she said, introducing me; 'my nephew, Mr.Harold Tillington. You've heard me talk of poor Tom Cayley, Harold? Thisis poor Tom Cayley's daughter.''Indeed?' the supercilious _attach\\u00e9_ put in, looking hard at me.'Delighted to make Miss Cayley's acquaintance.''Now, Harold, I can tell from your voice at once you haven't rememberedone word about Captain Cayley.'Harold stood on the defensive. 'My dear aunt,' he observed, expandingboth palms, 'I have heard you talk of so _very_ many people, that even_my_ diplomatic memory fails at times to recollect them all. But I dobetter: I dissemble. I will plead forgetfulness now of Captain Cayley,since you force it on me. It is not likely I shall have to plead it ofCaptain Cayley's daughter.' And he bowed towards me gallantly.The Cantankerous Old Lady darted a lightning glance at him. It was aglance of quick suspicion. Then she turned her R\\u00f6ntgen rays upon my faceonce more. I fear I burned crimson.'A friend?' he asked. 'Or a fellow-guest?''A companion.' It was the first nasty thing she had said of me.'Ha! more than a friend, then. A comrade.' He turned the edge neatly.We walked out on the terrace and a little way up the zigzag path. Theday was superb. I found Mr. Tillington, in spite of his studiouslylanguid and supercilious air, a most agreeable companion. He knewEurope. He was full of talk of Rome and the Romans. He had epigrammaticwit, curt, keen, and pointed. We sat down on a bench; he kept LadyGeorgina and myself amused for an hour by his crisp sallies. Besides, hehad been everywhere and seen everybody. Culture and agriculture seemedall one to him.When we rose to go in, Lady Georgina remarked, with emphasis, 'Ofcourse, Harold, you'll come and take up your diggings at our hotel?''Of course, my dear aunt. How can you ask? Free quarters. Nothing wouldgive me greater pleasure.'She glanced at him keenly again. I saw she had expected him to fake upsome lame excuse for not joining us; and I fancied she was annoyed athis prompt acquiescence, which had done her out of the chance for afamily disagreement. 'Oh, you'll come then?' she said, grudgingly.'Certainly, most respected aunt. I shall much prefer it.'She let her piercing eye descend upon me once more. I was aware that Ihad been talking with frank ease of manner to Mr. Tillington, and that Ihad said several things which clearly amused him. Then I remembered allat once our relative positions. A companion, I felt, should know herplace: it is not her _r\\u00f4le_ to be smart and amusing. 'Perhaps,' I said,drawing back, 'Mr. Tillington would like to remain in his presentquarters till the end of the week, while I am with you, Lady Georgina;after that, he could have my room; it might be more convenient.'His eye caught mine quickly. 'Oh, you're only going to stop a week,then, Miss Cayley?' he put in, with an air of disappointment.'Only a week,' I nodded.'My dear child,' the Cantankerous Old Lady broke out, 'what nonsense youdo talk! Only going to stop a week? How can I exist without you?''That was the arrangement,' I said, mischievously. 'You were going tolook about, you recollect, for an unsophisticated Gretchen. You don'thappen to know of any warehouse where a supply of unsophisticatedGretchens is kept constantly in stock, do you, Mr. Tillington?''No, I don't,' he answered, laughing. 'I believe there are dodos andauks' eggs, in very small numbers, still to be procured in the properquarters; but the unsophisticated Gretchen, I am credibly informed, isan extinct animal. Why, the cap of one fetches high prices nowadaysamong collectors.''But you will come to the hotel at once, Harold?' Lady Georginainterposed.'Certainly, aunt. I will move in without delay. If Miss Cayley is goingto stay for a single week only, that adds one extra inducement forjoining you immediately.'His aunt's stony eye was cold as marble.So when we got back to our hotel after the baths that afternoon, the_concierge_ greeted us with: 'Well, your noble nephew has arrived,high-well-born countess! He came with his boxes just now, and has takena room near your honourable ladyship's.'Lady Georgina's face was a study of mingled emotions. I don't knowwhether she looked more pleased or jealous.Later in the day, I chanced on Mr. Tillington, sunning himself on abench in the hotel garden. He rose, and came up to me, as fast as hislanguid nature permitted. 'Oh, Miss Cayley,' he said, abruptly, 'I dowant to thank you so much for not betraying me. I know you spotted metwice in the town yesterday; and I also know you were good enough to saynothing to my revered aunt about it.''I had no reason for wishing to hurt Lady Georgina's feelings,' Ianswered, with a permissible evasion.His countenance fell. 'I never thought of that,' he interposed, with onehand on his moustache. 'I-- I fancied you did it out of fellow-feeling.''We all think of things mainly from our own point of view first,' Ianswered. 'The difference is that some of us think of them from otherpeople's afterwards. Motives are mixed.'He smiled. 'I didn't know my deeply venerated relative was coming hereso soon,' he went on. 'I thought she wasn't expected till next week; mybrother wrote me that she had quarrelled with her French maid, and'twould take her full ten days to get another. I meant to clear outbefore she arrived. To tell you the truth, I was going to-morrow.''And now you are stopping on?'He caught my eye again.[Illustration: CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES, HE MURMURED.]'Circumstances alter cases,' he murmured, with meaning.'It is hardly polite to describe one as a circumstance,' I objected.'I meant,' he said, quickly, 'my aunt alone is one thing; my aunt with afriend is quite another.''I see,' I answered. 'There is safety in numbers.'He eyed me hard.'Are you medi\\u00e6val or modern?' he asked.'Modern, I hope,' I replied. Then I looked at him again. 'Oxford?'He nodded. 'And you?' half joking.'Cambridge,' I said, glad to catch him out. 'What college?''Merton. Yours?''Girton.'The odd rhyme amused him. Thenceforth we were friends--'two 'Varsitymen,' he said. And indeed it does make a queer sort of link--afreemasonry to which even women are now admitted.At dinner and through the evening he talked a great deal to me, LadyGeorgina putting in from time to time a characteristic growl about the_table-d'h\\u00f4te_ chicken--'a special breed, my dear, with eight drumsticksapiece'--or about the inadequate lighting of the heavy German _salon_.She was worse than ever: pungent as a rule, that evening she was grumpy.When we retired for the night, to my great surprise, she walked into mybedroom. She seated herself on my bed: I saw she had come to talk overHarold.'He will be very rich, my dear, you know. A great catch in time. He willinherit all my brother's money.''Lord Kynaston's?''Bless the child, no. Kynaston's as poor as a church mouse with thetithes unpaid; he has three sons of his own, and not a blessed stiver toleave between them. How could he, poor dear idiot? Agriculturaldepression; a splendid pauper. He has only the estate, and that's inEssex; land going begging; worth nothing a year, encumbered up to theeyes, and loaded with first rent-charges, jointures, settlements. Money,indeed! poor Kynaston! It's my brother Marmaduke's I mean; lucky dog,_he_ went in for speculation--began life as a guinea-pig, and rose withthe rise of soap and cocoa. He's worth his half-million.''Oh, Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst'Lady Georgina nodded. 'Marmy's a fool,' she said, briefly; 'but he knowswhich side of his bread is buttered.''And Mr. Tillington is--his nephew?''Bless the child, yes; have you never read your British Bible, thepeerage? Astonishing, the ignorance of these Girton girls! They don'teven know the Leger's run at Doncaster. The family name's Ashurst.Kynaston's an earl-- I was Lady Georgina Ashurst before I took it intomy head to marry and do for poor Evelyn Fawley. My younger brother's theHonourable Marmaduke Ashurst--women get the best of it there--it's aboutthe only place where they do get the best of it: an earl's daughter isLady Betty; his son's nothing more than the Honourable Tom. So onescores off one's brothers. My younger sister, Lady Guinevere Ashurst,married Stanley Tillington of the Foreign Office. Harold's their eldestson. Now, child, do you grasp it?''Perfectly,' I answered. 'You speak like Debrett. Has issue, Harold.''And Harold will inherit all Marmaduke's money. What I'm always afraidof is that some fascinating adventuress will try to marry him out ofhand. A pretty face, and over goes Harold! _My_ business in life is tostand in the way and prevent it.'She looked me through and through again with her X-ray scrutiny.'I don't think Mr. Tillington is quite the sort that falls a prey toadventuresses,' I answered, boldly.'Ah, but there are faggots and faggots,' the old lady said, wagging herhead with profound meaning. 'Never mind, though; _I'd_ like to see anadventuress marry off Harold without my leave! _I'd_ lead her a life!I'd turn her black hair gray for her!''I should think,' I assented, 'you could do it, Lady Georgina, if yougave your attention seriously to it.'From that moment forth, I was aware that my Cantankerous Old Lady'smalign eye was inexorably fixed upon me every time I went withinspeaking distance of Mr. Tillington. She watched him like a lynx. Shewatched _me_ like a dozen lynxes. Wherever we went, Lady Georgina wassure to turn up in the neighbourhood. She was perfectly ubiquitous: sheseemed to possess a world-wide circulation. I don't know whether it wasthis constant suggestion of hers that I was stalking her nephew whichroused my latent human feeling of opposition; but in the end, I began tobe aware that I rather liked the supercilious _attach\\u00e9_ than otherwise.He evidently liked me, and he tried to meet me. Whenever he spoke to me,indeed, it was without the superciliousness which marked his mannertowards others; in point of fact, it was with graceful deference. Hewatched for me on the stairs, in the garden, by the terrace; whenever hegot a chance, he sidled over and talked to me. Sometimes he stopped into read me Heine: he also introduced me to select portions of Gabrieled'Annunzio. It is feminine to be touched by such obvious attention; Iconfess, before long, I grew to like Mr. Harold Tillington.The closer he followed me up, the more did I perceive that Lady Georginathrew out acrid hints with increasing spleen about the ways ofadventuresses. They were hints of that acrimonious generalised kind,too, which one cannot answer back without seeming to admit that the caphas fitted. It was atrocious how middle-class young women nowadays ranafter young men of birth and fortune. A girl would stoop to anything inorder to catch five hundred thousand. Guileless youths should be thrownamong their natural equals. It was a mistake to let them see too much ofpeople of a lower rank who consider themselves good-looking. And theclever ones were the worst: they pretended to go in for intellectualcompanionship.I also noticed that though at first Lady Georgina had expressed thestrongest disinclination to my leaving her after the time originallyproposed, she now began to take for granted that I would go at the endof my week, as arranged in London, and she even went on to some overtsteps towards securing the help of the blameless Gretchen.We had arrived at Schlangenbad on Tuesday. I was to stop with theCantankerous Old Lady till the corresponding day of the following week.On the Sunday, I wandered out on the wooded hillside behind the village;and as I mounted the path I was dimly aware by a sort of instinct thatHarold Tillington was following me.He came up with me at last near a ledge of rock. 'How fast you walk!' heexclaimed. 'I gave you only a few minutes' start, and yet even my longlegs have had hard work to overtake you.''I am a fairly good climber,' I answered, sitting down on a littlewooden bench. 'You see, at Cambridge, I went on the river a great deal--I canoed and sculled: and then, besides, I've done a lot of bicycling.''What a splendid birthright it is,' he cried, 'to be a wholesomeathletic English girl! You can't think how one admires English girlsafter living a year or two in Italy--where women are dolls, except for abrief period of intrigue, before they settle down to be contented frumpswith an outline like a barrel.''A little muscle and a little mind are no doubt advisable adjuncts for ahousewife,' I admitted.'You shall not say that word,' he cried, seating himself at my side. 'Itis a word for Germans, \\\"housewife.\\\" Our English ideal is somethingimmeasurably higher and better. A companion, a complement! Do you know,Miss Cayley, it always sickens me when I hear German studentssentimentalising over their _m\\u00e4dchen_: their beautiful, pure, insipid,yellow-haired, blue-eyed _m\\u00e4dchen_; her, so fair, so innocent, sounapproachably vacuous--so like a wax doll--and then think of how theydesign her in days to come to cook sausages for their dinner, and knitthem endless stockings through a placid middle age, till the needlesdrop from her paralysed fingers, and she retires into frilled caps andTeutonic senility.''You seem to have almost as low an opinion of foreigners as yourrespected aunt!' I exclaimed, looking quizzically at him.He drew back, surprised. 'Oh, no; I'm not narrow-minded, like my aunt, Ihope,' he answered. 'I am a good cosmopolitan. I allow Continentalnations all their own good points, and each has many. But their women,Miss Cayley--and their point of view of their women--you will admit thatthere they can't hold a candle to English women.'I drew a circle in the dust with the tip of my parasol.'On that issue, I may not be a wholly unprejudiced observer,' Ianswered. 'The fact of my being myself an Englishwoman may possibly tosome extent influence my judgment.''You are sarcastic,' he cried, drawing away.'Not at all,' I answered, making a wider circle. 'I spoke a simple fact.But what is _your_ ideal, then, as opposed to the German one?'He gazed at me and hesitated. His lips half parted. 'My ideal?' he said,after a pause. 'Well, _my_ ideal--do you happen to have such a thing asa pocket-mirror about you?'I laughed in spite of myself. 'Now, Mr. Tillington,' I said severely,'if you're going to pay compliments, I shall have to return. If you wantto stop here with me, you must remember that I am only Lady GeorginaFawley's temporary lady's-maid. Besides, I didn't mean that. I meant,what is your ideal of a man's right relation to his _m\\u00e4dchen_?''Don't say _m\\u00e4dchen_,' he cried, petulantly. 'It sounds as if youthought me one of those sentimental Germans. I hate sentiment.''Then, towards the woman of his choice.'He glanced up through the trees at the light overhead, and spoke moreslowly than ever. 'I think,' he said, fumbling his watch-chainnervously, 'a man ought to wish the woman he loves to be a free agent,his equal in point of action, even as she is nobler and better than hein all spiritual matters. I think he ought to desire for her a life ashigh as she is capable of leading, with full scope for every faculty ofher intellect or her emotional nature. She should be beautiful, with avigorous, wholesome, many-sided beauty, moral, intellectual, physical;yet with soul in her, too; and with the soul and the mind lighting upher eyes, as it lights up--well, that is immaterial. And if a man candiscover such a woman as that, and can induce her to believe in him, tolove him, to accept him--though how such a woman can be satisfied withany man at all is to me unfathomable--well, then, I think he should behappy in devoting his whole life to her, and should give himself up torepay her condescension in taking him.''And you hate sentiment!' I put in, smiling.[Illustration: MISS CAYLEY, HE SAID, YOU ARE PLAYING WITH ME.]He brought his eyes back from the sky suddenly. 'Miss Cayley,' he said,'this is cruel. I was in earnest. You are playing with me.''I believe the chief characteristic of the English girl is supposed tobe common sense,' I answered, calmly, 'and I trust I possess it.' Butindeed, as he spoke, my heart was beginning to make its beat felt; forhe was a charming young man; he had a soft voice and lustrous eyes; itwas a summer's day; and alone in the woods with one other person, wherethe sunlight falls mellow in spots like a leopard's skin, one is apt toremember that we are all human.That evening Lady Georgina managed to blurt out more malicious thingsthan ever about the ways of adventuresses, and the duty of relations insaving young men from the clever clutches of designing creatures. Shewas ruthless in her rancour: her gibes stung me.On Monday at breakfast I asked her casually if she had yet found aGretchen.'No,' she answered, in a gloomy voice. 'All slatterns, my dear; allslatterns! Brought up in pig-sties. I wouldn't let one of them touch myhair for thousands.''That's unfortunate,' I said, drily, 'for you know I'm going to-morrow.'If I had dropped a bomb in their midst they couldn't have looked moreastonished. 'To-morrow?' Lady Georgina gasped, clutching my arm. 'Youdon't mean it, child; you don't mean it?'I asserted my Ego. 'Certainly,' I answered, with my coolest air. 'I saidI thought I could manage you for a week; and I have managed you.'She almost burst into tears. 'But, my child, my child, what shall I dowithout you?''The unsophisticated Gretchen,' I answered, trying not to lookconcerned; for in my heart of hearts, in spite of her innuendoes, I hadreally grown rather to like the Cantankerous Old Lady.She rose hastily from the table, and darted up to her own room. 'Lois,'she said, as she rose, in a curious voice of mingled regret andsuspicion, 'I will talk to you about this later.' I could see she wasnot quite satisfied in her own mind whether Harold Tillington and I hadnot arranged this _coup_ together.I put on my hat and strolled off into the garden, and then along themossy hill path. In a minute more, Harold Tillington was beside me.He seated me, half against my will, on a rustic bench. 'Look here, MissCayley,' he said, with a very earnest face; 'is this really true? Areyou going to-morrow?'My voice trembled a little. 'Yes,' I answered, biting my lip. 'I amgoing. I see several reasons why I should go, Mr. Tillington.''But so soon?''Yes, I think so; the sooner the better.' My heart was racing now, andhis eyes pleaded mutely.'Then where are you going?'I shrugged my shoulders, and pouted my lips a little. 'I don't know,' Ireplied. 'The world is all before me where to choose. I am anadventuress,' I said it boldly, 'and I am in quest of adventures. Ireally have not yet given a thought to my next place of sojourn.''But you will let me know when you have decided?'It was time to speak out. 'No, Mr. Tillington,' I said, with decision.'I will _not_ let you know. One of my reasons for going is, that I thinkI had better see no more of you.'He flung himself on the bench at my side, and folded his hands in ahelpless attitude. 'But, Miss Cayley,' he cried, 'this is so short anotice; you give a fellow no chance; I hoped I might have seen more ofyou--might have had some opportunity of--of letting you realise howdeeply I admired and respected you--some opportunity of showing myselfas I really am to you--before--before----' he paused, and looked hard atme.I did not know what to say. I really liked him so much; and when hespoke in that voice, I could not bear to seem cruel to him. Indeed, Iwas aware at the moment how much I had grown to care for him in thosesix short days. But I knew it was impossible. 'Don't say it, Mr.Tillington,' I murmured, turning my face away. 'The less said, thesooner mended.''But I must,' he cried. 'I must tell you now, if I am to have no chanceafterwards. I wanted you to see more of me before I ventured to ask youif you could ever love me, if you could ever suffer me to go throughlife with you, to share my all with you.' He seized my trembling hand.'Lois,' he cried, in a pleading voice, 'I _must_ ask you; I can't expectyou to answer me now, but _do_ say you will give me at least some otherchance of seeing you, and then, in time, of pressing my suit upon you.'Tears stood in my eyes. He was so earnest, so charming. But I rememberedLady Georgina, and his prospective half-million. I moved his hand awaygently. 'I cannot,' I said. 'I cannot-- I am a penniless girl--anadventuress. Your family, your uncle, would never forgive you if youmarried me. I will not stand in your way. I-- I like you very much,though I have seen so little of you. But I feel it is impossible--and Iam going to-morrow.'[Illustration: I ROSE OF A SUDDEN, AND RAN DOWN THE HILL.]Then I rose of a sudden, and ran down the hill with all my might, lest Ishould break my resolve, never stopping once till I reached my ownbedroom.An hour later, Lady Georgina burst in upon me in high dudgeon. 'Why,Lois, my child,' she cried. 'What's this? What on earth does it mean?Harold tells me he has proposed to you--proposed to you--and you'verejected him!'I dried my eyes and tried to look steadily at her. 'Yes, Lady Georgina,'I faltered. 'You need not be afraid. I have refused him; and I mean it.'She looked at me, all aghast. '_And_ you mean it!' she repeated. 'Youmean to refuse him. Then, all I can say is, Lois Cayley, I call it purecheek of you!''What?' I cried, drawing back.'Yes, cheek,' she answered, volubly. 'Forty thousand a year, and agood old family! Harold Tillington is my nephew; he's an earl'sgrandson; he's an _attach\\u00e9_ at Rome; and he's bound to be one of therichest commoners in England. Who are you, I'd like to know, miss, thatyou dare to reject him?'I stared at her, amazed. 'But, Lady Georgina,' I cried, 'you said youwished to protect your nephew against bare-faced adventuresses who weresetting their caps at him.'She fixed her eyes on me, half-angry, half-tremulous.'Of course,' she answered, with withering scorn. 'But, _then_, I thoughtyou were trying to catch him. He tells me now you won't have him, andyou won't tell him where you are going. I call it sheer insolence. Wheredo you hail from, girl, that you should refuse my nephew? A man that anywoman in England would be proud to marry! Forty thousand a year, and anearl's grandson! That's what comes, I suppose, of going to Girton!'I drew myself up. 'Lady Georgina,' I said, coldly, 'I cannot allow youto use such language to me. I promised to accompany you to Germany for aweek; and I have kept my word. I like your nephew; I respect yournephew; he has behaved like a gentleman. But I will _not_ marry him.Your own conduct showed me in the plainest way that you did not judgesuch a match desirable for him; and I have common sense enough to seethat you were quite right. I am a lady by birth and education; I am anofficer's daughter; but I am not what society calls \\\"a good match\\\" forMr. Tillington. He had better marry into a rich stockbroker's family.'It was an unworthy taunt: the moment it escaped my lips I regretted it.[Illustration: I WAS GOING TO OPPOSE YOU AND HAROLD.]To my intense surprise, however, Lady Georgina flung herself on my bed,and burst into tears. 'My dear,' she sobbed out, covering her face withher hands, 'I thought you would be sure to set your cap at Harold; andafter I had seen you for twenty-four hours, I said to myself, \\\"That'sjust the sort of girl Harold ought to fall in love with.\\\" I felt sure hewould fall in love with you. I brought you here on purpose. I saw youhad all the qualities that would strike Harold's fancy. So I had made upmy mind for a delightful regulation family quarrel. I was going tooppose you and Harold, tooth and nail; I was going to threaten thatMarmy would leave his money to Kynaston's eldest son; I was going tokick up, oh, a dickens of a row about it! Then, of course, in the end,we should all have been reconciled; we should have kissed and madefriends: for you're just the one girl in the world for Harold; indeed, Inever met anybody so capable and so intelligent. And now you spoil allmy sport by going and refusing him! It's really most ill-timed of you.And Harold has sent me here--he's trembling with anxiety--to see whetherI can't induce you to think better of your decision.'I made up my mind at once. 'No, Lady Georgina,' I said, in my gentlestvoice--positively stooping down and kissing her. 'I like Mr. Tillingtonvery much. I dare not tell you how much I like him. He is a dear, good,kind fellow. But I cannot rest under the cruel imputation of being movedby his wealth and having tried to capture him. Even if _you_ didn'tthink so, his family would. I am sorry to go; for in a way I like you.But it is best to adhere to our original plan. If _I_ changed my mind,_you_ might change yours again. Let us say no more. I will goto-morrow.''But you will see Harold again?''Not alone. Only at dinner.' For I feared lest, if he spoke to me alone,he might over-persuade me.'Then at least you will tell him where you are going?''No, Lady Georgina; I do not know myself. And besides, it is best thatthis should now be final.'She flung herself upon me. 'But, my dear child, a lady can't go out intothe world with only two pounds in pocket. You _must_ let me lend yousomething.'I unwound her clasping hands. 'No, dear Lady Georgina,' I said, though Iwas loth to say it. 'You are very sweet and good, but I must work out mylife in my own way. I have started to work it out, and I won't be turnedaside just here on the threshold.''And you won't stop with me?' she cried, opening her arms. 'You think metoo cantankerous?''I think you have a dear, kind old heart,' I said, 'under the quaintestand crustiest outside such a heart ever wore; you're a truculent olddarling: so that's the plain truth of it.'She kissed me. I kissed her in return with fervour, though I am but apoor hand at kissing, for a woman. 'So now this episode is concluded,' Imurmured.'I don't know about that,' she said, drying her eyes. 'I have set myheart upon you now; and Harold has set his heart upon you; andconsidering that your own heart goes much the same way, I daresay, mydear, we shall find in the end some convenient road out of it.'Nevertheless, next morning I set out by myself in the coach fromSchlangenbad. I went forth into the world to live my own life, partlybecause it was just then so fashionable, but mainly because fate haddenied me the chance of living anybody else's.IIITHE ADVENTURE OF THE INQUISITIVE AMERICANIn one week I had multiplied my capital two hundred and forty-fold! Ileft London with twopence in the world; I quitted Schlangenbad with twopounds in pocket.'There's a splendid turn-over!' I thought to myself. 'If this luckholds, at the same rate, I shall have made four hundred and eightypounds by Tuesday next, and I may look forward to being a Barney Barnatoby Christmas.' For I had taken high mathematical honours at Cambridge,and if there is anything on earth on which I pride myself, it is my firmgrasp of the principle of ratios.Still, in spite of this brilliant financial prospect, a buddingKlondike, I went away from the little Spa on the flanks of the Taunuswith a heavy heart. I had grown quite to like dear, virulent, fidgetyold Lady Georgina; and I felt that it had cost me a distinct wrench topart with Harold Tillington. The wrench left a scar which was long inhealing; but as I am not a professional sentimentalist, I will nottrouble you here with details of the symptoms.My livelihood, however, was now assured me. With two pounds in pocket, asensible girl can read her title clear to six days' board and lodging,at six marks a day, with a glorious margin of four marks over forpocket-money. And if at the end of six days my fairy godmother had notpointed me out some other means of earning my bread honestly--well, Ishould feel myself unworthy to be ranked in the noble army ofadventuresses. I thank thee, Lady Georgina, for teaching me that word.An adventuress I would be; for I loved adventure.Meanwhile, it occurred to me that I might fill up the interval by goingto study art at Frankfort. Elsie Petheridge had been there, and hadimpressed upon me the fact that I must on no account omit to see theSt\\u00e4del Gallery. She was strong on culture. Besides, the study of artshould be most useful to an adventuress; for she must need all the artsthat human skill has developed.So to Frankfort I betook myself, and found there a nice little_pension_--'for ladies only,' Frau Bockenheifner assured me--at verymoderate rates, in a pleasant part of the Lindenstrasse. It had dimitycurtains. I will not deny that as I entered the house I was conscious offeeling lonely; my heart sank once or twice as I glanced round theluncheon-table at the domestically-unsympathetic German old maids whoformed the rank-and-file of my fellow-boarders. There they sat--eightcomfortable Fraus who had missed their vocation; plentiful ladies,bulging and surging in tightly stretched black silk bodices. They hadbeen cut out for such housewives as Harold Tillington had described, butfound themselves deprived of their natural sphere in life by theunaccountable caprice of the men of their nation. Each was a modelTeutonic matron _manqu\\u00e9e_. Each looked capable of frying Frankfortsausages to a turn, and knitting woollen socks to a remote eternity. ButI sought in vain for one kindred soul among them. How horrified theywould have been, with their fat pudding-faces and big saucer-eyes, had Iboldly announced myself as an English adventuress!I spent my first morning in laborious self-education at the Ariadneumand the St\\u00e4del Gallery. I borrowed a catalogue. I wrestled with Van derWeyden; I toiled like a galley-slave at Meister Wilhelm and MeisterStephan. I have a confused recollection that I saw a number of stiffmedi\\u00e6val pictures, and an alabaster statue of the lady who smiled as sherode on a tiger, taken at the beginning of that interesting episode. Butthe remainder of the Institute has faded from my memory.In the afternoon I consoled myself for my herculean efforts in thedirection of culture by going out for a bicycle ride on a hired machine,to which end I decided to devote my pocket-money. You will, perhaps,object here that my conduct was imprudent. To raise that objection is tomisunderstand the spirit of these artless adventures. I told you that Iset out to go round the world; but to go round the world does notnecessarily mean to circumnavigate it. My idea was to go round by easystages, seeing the world as I went as far as I got, and taking as littleheed as possible of the morrow. Most of my readers, no doubt, acceptthat philosophy of life on Sundays only; on week-days they swallow theusual contradictory economic platitudes about prudential forethought andthe horrid improvidence of the lower classes. For myself, I am not builtthat way. I prefer to take life in a spirit of pure inquiry. I put on myhat: I saunter where I choose, so far as circumstances permit; and Iwait to see what chance will bring me. My ideal is breeziness.The hired bicycle was not a bad machine, as hired bicycles go; it joltedone as little as you can expect from a common hack; it never stopped ata Bier-Garten; and it showed very few signs of having been ridden bybeginners with an unconquerable desire to tilt at the hedgerow. So offI soared at once, heedless of the jeers of Teutonic youth who found thesight of a lady riding a cycle in skirts a strange one--for in SouthGermany the 'rational' costume is so universal among women cyclists that'tis the skirt that provokes unfavourable comment from those jealousguardians of female propriety, the street boys. I hurried on at a briskpace past the Palm-Garden and the suburbs, with my loose hair strayingon the breeze behind, till I found myself pedalling at a good round paceon a broad, level road, which led towards a village, by name Fraunheim.As I scurried across the plain, with the wind in my face, notunpleasantly, I had some dim consciousness of somebody unknown flyingafter me headlong. My first idea was that Harold Tillington had huntedme down and tracked me to my lair; but gazing back, I saw my pursuer wasa tall and ungainly man, with a straw-coloured moustache, apparentlyAmerican, and that he was following me on his machine, closely watchingmy action. He had such a cunning expression on his face, and seemed sostrangely inquisitive, with eyes riveted on my treadles, that I didn'tquite like the look of him. I put on the pace, to see if I couldoutstrip him, for I am a swift cyclist. But his long legs were too muchfor me. He did not gain on me, it is true; but neither did I outpacehim. Pedalling my very hardest--and I can make good time whennecessary--I still kept pretty much at the same distance in front of himall the way to Fraunheim.[Illustration: HE KEPT CLOSE AT MY HEELS.]Gradually I began to feel sure that the weedy-looking man with the alertface was really pursuing me. When I went faster, he went faster too;when I gave him a chance to pass me, he kept close at my heels, andappeared to be keenly watching the style of my ankle-action. I gatheredthat he was a connoisseur; but why on earth he should persecute me Icould not imagine. My spirit was roused now-- I pedalled with a will; ifI rode all day I would not let him go past me.Beyond the cobble-paved chief street of Fraunheim the road took a sharpbend, and began to mount the slopes of the Taunus suddenly. It was anabrupt, steep climb; but I flatter myself I am a tolerable mountaincyclist. I rode sturdily on; my pursuer darted after me. But on thisstiff upward grade my light weight and agile ankle-action told; I beganto distance him. He seemed afraid that I would give him the slip, andcalled out suddenly, with a whoop, in English, 'Stop, miss!' I lookedback with dignity, but answered nothing. He put on the pace, panting; Ipedalled away, and got clear from him.[Illustration: I WAS PULLED UP SHORT BY A MOUNTED POLICEMAN.]At a turn of the corner, however, as luck would have it, I was pulled upshort by a mounted policeman. He blocked the road with his horse, likean ogre, and asked me, in a very gruff Swabian voice, if this was alicensed bicycle. I had no idea, till he spoke, that any license wasrequired; though to be sure I might have guessed it; for modern Germanyis studded with notices at all the street corners, to inform you inminute detail that everything is forbidden. I stammered out that I didnot know. The mounted policeman drew near and inspected me rudely. 'Itis strongly undersaid,' he began, but just at that moment my pursuercame up, and, with American quickness, took in the situation. Heaccosted the policeman in choice bad German. 'I have two licenses,' hesaid, producing a handful. 'The Fr\\u00e4ulein rides with me.'I was too much taken aback at so providential an interposition tocontradict this highly imaginative statement. My highwayman had turnedinto a protecting knight-errant of injured innocence. I let thepoliceman go his way; then I glanced at my preserver. A very ordinarymodern St. George he looked, with no lance to speak of, and no steed buta bicycle. Yet his mien was reassuring.'Good morning, miss,' he began--he called me 'Miss' every time headdressed me, as though he took me for a barmaid. 'Ex-cuse _me_, but whydid you want to speed her?''I thought you were pursuing me,' I answered, a little tremulous, I willconfess, but avid of incident.'And if I was,' he went on, 'you might have con-jectured, miss, it wasfor our mutual advantage. A business man don't go out of his way unlesshe expects to turn an honest dollar; and he don't reckon on other folksgoing out of theirs, unless he knows he can put them in the way ofturning an honest dollar with him.''That's reasonable,' I answered: for I am a political economist. 'Thebenefit should be mutual.' But I wondered if he was going to propose atsight to me.He looked me all up and down. 'You're a lady of con-siderable personalattractions,' he said, musingly, as if he were criticising a horse; 'andI want one that sort. That's jest why I trailed you, see? Besides which,there's some style about you.''Style!' I repeated.'Yes,' he went on; 'you know how to use your feet; and you have goodunderstandings.'I gathered from his glance that he referred to my nether limbs. We areall vertebrate animals; why seek to conceal the fact?'I fail to follow you,' I answered frigidly; for I really didn't knowwhat the man might say next.[Illustration: SEEMS I DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A JOB OF IT.]'That's so!' he replied. 'It was _I_ that followed _you_; seems I didn'tmake much of a job of it, either, anyway.'I mounted my machine again. 'Well, good morning,' I said, coldy. 'I ammuch obliged for your kind assistance; but your remark was fictitious,and I desire to go on unaccompanied.'He held up his hand in warning. 'You ain't going!' he cried, horrified.'You ain't going without hearing me! I mean business, say! Don't chuckaway good money like that. I tell you, there's dollars in it.''In what?' I asked, still moving on, but curious. On the slope, if needwere, I could easily distance him.'Why, in this cycling of yours,' he replied. 'You're jest about the verywoman I'm looking for, miss. Lithe--that's what I call you. I kin putyou in the way of making your pile, I kin. This is a _bon\\u00e2-fide_ offer.No flies on _my_ business! You decline it? Prejudice! Injures you;injures me! Be reasonable anyway!'I looked round and laughed. 'Formulate yourself,' I said, briefly.He rose to it like a man. 'Meet me at Fraunheim; corner by the PostOffice; ten o'clock to-morrow morning,' he shouted, as I rode off, 'andef I don't convince you there's money in this job, my name's not CyrusW. Hitchcock.'Something about his keen, unlovely face impressed me with a sense of hisunderlying honesty. 'Very well,' I answered,'I'll come, if you follow meno further.' I reflected that Fraunheim was a populous village, and thatonly beyond it did the mountain road over the Taunus begin to growlonely. If he wished to cut my throat, I was well within reach of theresources of civilisation.When I got home to the Abode of Blighted Fraus that evening, I debatedseriously with myself whether or not I should accept Mr. Cyrus W.Hitchcock's mysterious invitation. Prudence said _no_; curiosity said_yes_; I put the question to a meeting of one; and, since I am adaughter of Eve, curiosity had it. Carried unanimously. I think I mighthave hesitated, indeed, had it not been for the Blighted Fraus. Theirtalk was of dinner and of the digestive process; they were critics ofdigestion. They each of them sat so complacently through theevening--solid and stolid, stodgy and podgy, stuffed comatose images,knitting white woollen shawls, to throw over their capacious shouldersat _table d'h\\u00f4te_--and they purred with such content in theirmiddle-aged rotundity that I made up my mind I must take warningbetimes, and avoid their temptations to adipose deposit. I prefer togrow upwards; the Frau grows sideways. Better get my throat cut by anAmerican desperado, in my pursuit of romance, than settle down on a rocklike a placid fat oyster. I am not by nature sessile.Adventures are to the adventurous. They abound on every side; but onlythe chosen few have the courage to embrace them. And they will not cometo you: you must go out to seek them. Then they meet you half-way, andrush into your arms, for they know their true lovers. There were eightBlighted Fraus at the Home for Lost Ideals, and I could tell by simpleinspection that they had not had an average of half an adventure perlifetime between them. They sat and knitted still, like Awful Examples.If I had declined to meet Mr. Hitchcock at Fraunheim, I know not whatchanges it might have induced in my life. I might now be knitting. But Iwent boldly forth, on a voyage of exploration, prepared to accept aughtthat fate held in store for me.As Mr. Hitchcock had assured me there was money in his offer, I feltjustified in speculating. I expended another three marks on the hire ofa bicycle, though I ran the risk thereby of going perhaps withoutMonday's dinner. That showed my vocation. The Blighted Fraus, I feltsure, would have clung to their dinner at all hazards.When I arrived at Fraunheim, I found my alert American punctually therebefore me. He raised his crush hat with awkward politeness. I could seehe was little accustomed to ladies' society. Then he pointed to a closecab in which he had reached the village.'I've got it inside,' he whispered, in a confidential tone. 'I couldn'tlet 'em ketch sight of it. You see, there's dollars in it.''What have you got inside?' I asked, suspiciously, drawing back. I don'tknow why, but the word 'it' somehow suggested a corpse. I began to growfrightened.'Why, the wheel, of course,' he answered. 'Ain't you come here to rideit?''Oh, the wheel?' I echoed, vaguely, pretending to look wise; butunaware, as yet, that that word was the accepted Americanism for acycle. 'And I have come to ride it?''Why, certainly,' he replied, jerking his hand towards the cab. 'But wemustn't start right here. This thing has got to be kept dark, don't yousee, till the last day.'Till the last day! That was ominous. It sounded like monomania. Soghostly and elusive! I began to suspect my American ally of being adangerous madman.'Jest you wheel away a bit up the hill,' he went on, 'out o' sight ofthe folks, and I'll fetch her along to you.''Her?' I cried. 'Who?' For the man bewildered me.'Why, the wheel, miss! _You_ understand! This is business, you bet! Andyou're jest the right woman!'He motioned me on. Urged by a sort of spell, I remounted my machine androde out of the village. He followed, on the box-seat of his cab. Then,when we had left the world well behind, and stood among the sun-smittenboles of the pine-trees, he opened the door mysteriously, and producedfrom the vehicle a very odd-looking bicycle.It was clumsy to look at. It differed immensely, in many particulars,from any machine I had yet seen or ridden.The strenuous American fondled it for a moment with his hand, as if itwere a pet child. Then he mounted nimbly. Pride shone in his eye. I sawin a second he was a fond inventor.He rode a few yards on. Next he turned to me eagerly. 'This ma-chine,'he said, in an impressive voice, '_is_ pro-pelled _by_ an eccentric.'Like all his countrymen, he laid most stress on unaccented syllables.'Oh, I knew you were an eccentric,' I said, 'the moment I set eyes uponyou.'He surveyed me gravely. 'You misunderstand me, miss,' he corrected.'_When_ I say an eccentric, I mean, a crank.''They are much the same thing,' I answered, briskly. 'Though I confess Iwould hardly have applied so rude a word as _crank_ to you.'He looked me over suspiciously, as if I were trying to make game of him,but my face was sphinx-like. So he brought the machine a yard or twonearer, and explained its construction to me. He was quite right: it_was_ driven by a crank. It had no chain, but was moved by a pedal,working narrowly up and down, and attached to a rigid bar, whichimpelled the wheels by means of an eccentric.Besides this, it had a curious device for altering the gearingautomatically while one rode, so as to enable one to adapt it to thevarying slope in mounting hills. This part of the mechanism he explainedto me elaborately. There was a gauge in front which allowed one to sightthe steepness of the slope by mere inspection; and according as thegauge marked one, two, three, or four, as its gradient on the scale,the rider pressed a button on the handle-bar with his left hand once,twice, thrice, or four times, so that the gearing adapted itself withoutan effort to the rise in the surface. Besides, there were devices forrigidity and compensation. Altogether, it was a most apt and ingeniouspiece of mechanism. I did not wonder he was proud of it.'Get up and ride, miss,' he said in a persuasive voice.I did as I was bid. To my immense surprise, I ran up the steep hill assmoothly and easily as if it were a perfectly-laid level.'Goes nicely, doesn't she?' Mr. Hitchcock murmured, rubbing his hands.'Beautifully,' I answered. 'One could ride such a machine up Mont Blanc,I should fancy.'He stroked his chin with nervous fingers. 'It ought to knock 'em,' hesaid, in an eager voice. 'It's geared to run up most anything increation.''How steep?''One foot in three.''That's good.''Yes. It'll climb Mount Washington.''What do you call it?' I asked.He looked me over with close scrutiny.'In Amurrica,' he said, slowly, 'we call it the Great Manitou, becauseit kin do pretty well what it chooses; but in Europe, I am thinking ofcalling it the Martin Conway or the Whymper, or something like that.''Why so?''Well, because it's a famous mountain climber.''I see,' I said. 'With such a machine you'll put a notice on theMatterhorn, \\\"This hill is dangerous to cyclists.\\\"'He laughed low to himself, and rubbed his hands again. 'You'll do,miss,' he said. 'You're the right sort, you are. The moment I seen you,I thought we two could do a trade together. Benefits me; benefits you. Amutual advantage. Reciprocity is the soul of business. You hev some goin you, you hev. There's money in your feet. You'll give these Meinherrsfits. You'll take the clear-starch out of them.''I fail to catch on,' I answered, speaking his own dialect to humourhim.'Oh, you'll get there all the same,' he replied, stroking his machinemeanwhile. 'It was a squirrel, it was!' (He pronounced it _squirl_.) 'It'ud run up a tree ef it wanted, wouldn't it?' He was talking to it nowas if it were a dog or a baby. 'There, there, it mustn't kick; it was afrisky little thing! Jest you step up on it, miss, and have a go at thatthere mountain.'I stepped up and had a 'go.' The machine bounded forward like an agilegreyhound. You had but to touch it, and it ran of itself. Never had Iridden so vivacious, so animated a cycle. I returned to him, sailing,with the gradient reversed. The Manitou glided smoothly, as on a gentleslope, without the need for back-pedalling.'It soars!' he remarked with enthusiasm.'Balloons are at discount beside it,' I answered.'Now you want to know about this business, I guess,' he went on. 'Youwant to know jest where the reciprocity comes in, anyhow?''I am ready to hear you expound,' I admitted, smiling.'Oh, it ain't all on one side,' he continued, eyeing his machine at anangle with parental affection. 'I'm a-going to make your fortune righthere. You shall ride her for me on the last day; and ef you pull thisthing off, don't you be scared that I won't treat you handsome.''If you were a little more succinct,' I said, gravely, 'we should getforrader faster.''Perhaps you wonder,' he put in, 'that with money on it like this, Ishould intrust the job _into_ the hands of a female.' I winced, but wassilent. 'Well, it's like this, don't you see; ef a female wins, it makessuccess all the more striking and con-spicuous. The world to-day _is_ruled _by_ adver_tize_ment.'I could stand it no longer. 'Mr. Hitchcock,' I said, with dignity, 'Ihaven't the remotest idea what on earth you are talking about.'He gazed at me with surprise. 'What?' he exclaimed, at last. 'And youkin cycle like that! Not know what all the cycling world is mad about!Why, you don't mean to tell me you're not a pro-fessional?'I enlightened him at once as to my position in society, which wasrespectable, if not lucrative. His face fell somewhat. 'High-toned, eh?Still, you'd run all the same, wouldn't you?' he inquired.'Run for what?' I asked, innocently. 'Parliament? The Presidency? TheFrankfort Town Council?'He had difficulty in fathoming the depths of my ignorance. But bydegrees I understood him. It seemed that the German Imperial andPrussian Royal Governments had offered a Kaiserly and Kingly prize forthe best military bicycle; the course to be run over the Taunus, fromFrankfort to Limburg; the winning machine to get the equivalent of athousand pounds; each firm to supply its own make and rider. The 'lastday' was Saturday next; and the Great Manitou was the dark horse of thecontest.Then all was clear as day to me. Mr. Cyrus W. Hitchcock was keeping hismachine a profound secret; he wanted a woman to ride it, so that histriumph might be the more complete; and the moment he saw me pedal upthe hill, in trying to avoid him, he recognised at once that I was thatwoman.I recognised it too. 'Twas a pre-ordained harmony. After two or threetrials I felt that the Manitou was built for me, and I was built for theManitou. We ran together like parts of one mechanism. I was always famedfor my circular ankle-action; and in this new machine, ankle-action waseverything. Strength of limb counted for naught; what told was the powerof 'clawing up again' promptly. I possess that power: I have prehistoricfeet: my remote progenitors must certainly have been tree-hauntingmonkeys.We arranged terms then and there.'You accept?''Implicitly.'If I pulled off the race, I was to have fifty pounds. If I didn't, I wasto have five. 'It ain't only your skill, you see,' Mr. Hitchcock said,with frank commercialism. 'It's your personal attractiveness as wellthat I go upon. That's an element to consider in business relations.''My face is my fortune,' I answered, gravely. He nodded acquiescence.Till Saturday, then, I was free. Meanwhile, I trained, and practisedquietly with the Manitou, in sequestered parts of the hills. I also tookspells, turn about, at the St\\u00e4del Institute. I like to intersperseculture and athletics. I know something about athletics, and hope intime to acquire a taste for culture. 'Tis expected of a Girton girl,though my own accomplishments run rather towards rowing, punting,bicycling.On Saturday, I confess, I rose with great misgivings. I was not aprofessional; and to find oneself practically backed for a thousandpounds in a race against men is a trifle disquieting. Still, havingonce put my hand to the plough, I felt I was bound to pull it throughsomehow. I dressed my hair neatly, in a very tight coil. I ate a lightbreakfast, eschewing the fried sausages which the Blighted Fraus pressedupon my notice, and satisfying myself with a gently-boiled egg and sometoast and coffee. I always found I rowed best at Cambridge on thelightest diet; in my opinion, the raw beef _r\\u00e9gime_ is a serious errorin training.At a minute or two before eleven I turned up at the Schiller Platz in myshort serge dress and cycling jacket. The great square was thronged withspectators to see us start; the police made a lane through their midstfor the riders. My backer had advised me to come to the post as late aspossible, 'For I have entered your name,' he said, 'simply as LoisCayley. These Deutschers don't think but what you're a man and abrother. But I am apprehensive of con-tingencies. When you put in a showthey'll try to raise objections to you on account of your being afemale. There won't be much time, though, and I shall rush theobjections. Once they let you run and win, it don't matter to me whetherI get the twenty thousand marks or not. It's the adver_tize_ment thattells. Jest you mark my words, miss, and don't you make no mistake aboutit--the world to-day is governed by adver_tize_ment.'So I turned up at the last moment, and cast a timid glance at mycompetitors. They were all men, of course, and two of them were Germanofficers in a sort of undress cycling uniform. They eyed mesuperciliously. One of them went up and spoke to the HerrOver-Superintendent who had charge of the contest. I understood him tobe lodging an objection against a mere woman taking part in the race.The Herr Over-Superintendent, a bulky official, came up beside me andperpended visibly. He bent his big brows to it. 'Twas appalling toobserve the measurable amount of Teutonic cerebration going on undercover of his round, green glasses. He was perpending for some minutes.Time was almost up. Then he turned to Mr. Hitchcock, having finally madeup his colossal mind, and murmured rudely, 'The woman cannot compete.''Why not?' I inquired, in my very sweetest German, with an angelicsmile, though my heart trembled.'Warum nicht? Because the word \\\"rider\\\" in the Kaiserly and Kinglyfor-this-contest-provided decree is distinctly in the masculine genderstated.''Pardon me, Herr Over-Superintendent,' I replied, pulling out a copy ofLaw 97 on the subject, with which I had duly provided myself, 'if youwill to Section 45 of the Bicycles-Circulation-Regulation-Act yourattention turn, you will find it therein expressly enacted that unlessany clause be anywhere to the contrary inserted, the word \\\"rider,\\\" inthe masculine gender put, shall here the word \\\"rideress\\\" in the feminineto embrace be considered.'For, anticipating this objection, I had taken the precaution to look thelegal question up beforehand.'That is true,' the Herr Over-Superintendent observed, in a musingvoice, gazing down at me with relenting eyes. 'The masculine habituallyembraces the feminine.' And he brought his massive intellect to bearupon the problem once more with prodigious concentration.I seized my opportunity. 'Let me start, at least,' I urged, holding outthe Act. 'If I win, you can the matter more fully with the Kaiserly andKingly Governments hereafter argue out.''I guess this will be an international affair,' Mr. Hitchcock remarked,well pleased. 'It would be a first-rate adver_tize_ment for the GreatManitou ef England and Germany were to make the question into a _casusbelli_. The United States could look on, and pocket the chestnuts.''Two minutes to go,' the official starter with the watch called out.'Fall in, then, Fr\\u00e4ulein Engl\\u00e4nderin,' the Herr Over-Superintendentobserved, without prejudice, waving me into line. He pinned a badge witha large number, 7, on my dress. 'The Kaiserly and Kingly Governmentsshall on the affair of the starting's legality hereafter on my reportmore at leisure pass judgment.'The lieutenant in undress uniform drew back a little.'Oh, if this is to be woman's play,' he muttered, 'then can a Prussianofficer himself by competing not into contempt bring.'I dropped a little curtsy. 'If the Herr Lieutenant is afraid even to_enter_ against an Englishwoman----' I said, smiling.He came up to the scratch sullenly. 'One minute to go!' called out thestarter.We were all on the alert. There was a pause; a deep breath. I washorribly frightened, but I tried to look calm. Then sharp and quick camethe one word 'Go!' And like arrows from a bow, off we all started.I had ridden over the whole course the day but one before, on a mountainpony, with an observant eye and my sedulous American--rising at fiveo'clock, so as not to excite undue attention; and I therefore knewbeforehand the exact route we were to follow; but I confess when I sawthe Prussian lieutenant and one of my other competitors dash forward ata pace that simply astonished me, that fifty pounds seemed to melt awayin the dim abyss of the Ewigkeit. I gave up all for lost. I could nevermake the running against such practised cyclists.[Illustration: DON'T SCORCH, MISS; DON'T SCORCH.]However, we all turned out into the open road which leads across theplain and down the Main valley, in the direction of Mayence. For thefirst ten miles or so, it is a dusty level. The surface is perfect; but'twas a blinding white thread. As I toiled along it, that broiling Juneday, I could hear the voice of my backer, who followed on horseback,exhorting me in loud tones, 'Don't scorch, miss; don't scorch; nevermind ef you lose sight of 'em. Keep your wind; that's the point. Thewind, the wind's everything. Let 'em beat you on the level; you'll catch'em up fast enough when you get on the Taunus!'But in spite of his encouragement, I almost lost heart as I saw oneafter another of my opponents' backs disappear in the distance, till atlast I was left toiling along the bare white road alone, in ashower-bath of sunlight, with just a dense cloud of dust rising gray farahead of me. My head swam. It repented me of my boldness.Then the riders on horseback began to grumble; for by police regulationthey were not allowed to pass the hindmost of the cyclists; and theywere kept back by my presence from following up their special champions.'Give it up, Fr\\u00e4ulein, give it up!' they cried. 'You're beaten. Let uspass and get forward.' But at the self-same moment, I heard the shrillvoice of my American friend whooping aloud across the din, 'Don't you donothing of the sort, miss! You stick to it, and keep your wind! It's thewind that wins! Them Germans won't be worth a cent on the high slopes,anyway!'Encouraged by his voice, I worked steadily on, neither scorching norrelaxing, but maintaining an even pace at my natural pitch under thebroiling sunshine. Heat rose in waves on my face from the road below; inthe thin white dust, the accusing tracks of six wheels confronted me.Still I kept on following them, till I reached the town of H\\u00f6chst--ninemiles from Frankfort. Soldiers along the route were timing us atintervals with chronometers, and noting our numbers. As I rattled overthe paved High Street, I called aloud to one of them. 'How far ahead thelast man?'He shouted back, good-humouredly: 'Four minutes, Fr\\u00e4ulein.'Again I lost heart. Then I mounted a slight slope, and felt how easilythe Manitou moved up the gradient. From its summit I could note a longgray cloud of dust rolling steadily onward down the hill towardsHattersheim.I coasted down, with my feet up, and a slight breeze just cooling me.Mr. Hitchcock, behind, called out, full-throated, from his seat, 'Nohurry! No flurry! Take your time! Take--your--time, miss!'Over the bridge at Hattersheim you turn to the right abruptly, and beginto mount by the side of a pretty little stream, the Schwarzbach, whichruns brawling over rocks down the Taunus from Eppstein. By this time theexcitement had somewhat cooled down for the moment; I was gettingreconciled to be beaten on the level, and began to realise that mychances would be best as we approached the steepest bits of the mountainroad about Niederhausen. So I positively plucked up heart to look aboutme and enjoy the scenery. With hair flying behind--that coil had playedme false--I swept through Hofheim, a pleasant little village at themouth of a grassy valley inclosed by wooded slopes, the Schwarzbachmaking cool music in the glen below as I mounted beside it. Clamberinglarches, like huge candelabra, stood out on the ridge, silhouettedagainst the skyline.'How far ahead the last man?' I cried to the recording soldier. Heanswered me back, 'Two minutes, Fr\\u00e4ulein.'I was gaining on them; I was gaining! I thundered across theSchwarzbach, by half-a-dozen clamorous little iron bridges, making easytime now, and with my feet working as if they were themselves anintegral part of the machinery. Up, up, up; it looked a vertical ascent;the Manitou glided well in its oil-bath at its half-way gearing. I rodefor dear life. At sixteen miles, Lorsbach; at eighteen, Eppstein; theroad still rising. 'How far ahead the last man?' 'Just round the corner,Fr\\u00e4ulein!'I put on a little steam. Sure enough, round the corner I caught sight ofhis back. With a spurt, I passed him--a dust-covered soul, very hot anduncomfortable. He had not kept his wind; I flew past him like awhirlwind. But, oh, how sultry hot in that sweltering, close valley! Apretty little town, Eppstein, with its medi\\u00e6val castle perched high on acraggy rock. I owed it some gratitude, I felt, as I left it behind, for'twas here that I came up with the tail-end of my opponents.That one victory cheered me. So far, our route had lain along thewell-made but dusty high road in the steaming valley; at Nieder-Josbach,two miles on, we quitted the road abruptly, by the course marked out forus, and turned up a mountain path, only wide enough for two cyclesabreast--a path that clambered towards the higher slopes of the Taunus.That was arranged on purpose--for this was no fair-weather show, but apractical trial for military bicycles, under the conditions they mightmeet with in actual warfare. It was rugged riding: black walls of pinerose steep on either hand; the ground was uncertain. Our path mountedsharply from the first; the steeper the better. By the time I hadreached Ober-Josbach, nestling high among larch-woods, I had distancedall but two of my opponents. It was cooler now, too. As I passed thehamlet my cry altered.[Illustration: HOW FAR AHEAD THE FIRST MAN?]'How far ahead the first man?'.'Two minutes, Fr\\u00e4ulein,''A civilian?''No, no; a Prussian officer.'The Herr Lieutenant led, then. For Old England's sake, I felt I mustbeat him.The steepest slope of all lay in the next two miles. If I were going towin I must pass these two there, for my advantage lay all in the climb;if it came to coasting, the men's mere weight scored a point in theirfavour. Bump, crash, jolt! I pedalled away like a machine; the Manitousobbed; my ankles flew round so that I scarcely felt them. But the roadwas rough and scarred with waterways--ruts turned by rain to runnels. Athalf a mile, after a desperate struggle among sand and pebbles, I passedthe second man; just ahead, the Prussian officer looked round and sawme. 'Thunder-weather! you there, Engl\\u00e4nderin?' he cried, darting me alook of unchivalrous dislike, such as only your sentimental German cancast at a woman.[Illustration: I AM HERE BEHIND YOU, HERR LIEUTENANT.]'Yes, I am here, behind you, Herr Lieutenant,' I answered, putting on aspurt; 'and I hope next to be before you.'He answered not a word, but worked his hardest. So did I. He bentforward: I sat erect on my Manitou, pulling hard at my handles. Now, myfront wheel was upon him. It reached his pedal. We were abreast. He hada narrow thread of solid path, and he forced me into a runnel. Still Igained. He swerved: I think he tried to foul me. But the slope was toosteep; his attempt recoiled on himself; he ran against the rock at theside and almost overbalanced. That second lost him. I waved my hand as Isailed ahead. 'Good morning,' I cried, gaily. 'See you again atLimburg!'From the top of the slope I put my feet up and flew down into Idstein. Athunder-shower burst: I was glad of the cool of it. It laid the dust. Iregained the high road. From that moment, save for the risk ofsideslips, 'twas easy running--just an undulating line with occasionalups and downs; but I saw no more of my pursuers till, twenty-twokilometres farther on, I rattled on the cobble-paved causeway intoLimburg. I had covered the forty-six miles in quick time for a mountainclimb. As I crossed the bridge over the Lahn, to my immense surprise,Mr. Hitchcock waved his arms, all excitement, to greet me. He had takenthe train on from Eppstein, it seemed, and got there before me. As Idismounted at the Cathedral, which was our appointed end, and gave mybadge to the soldier, he rushed up and shook my hand. 'Fifty pounds!' hecried. 'Fifty pounds! How's that for the great Anglo-Saxon race! Andhooray for the Manitou!'The second man, the civilian, rode in, wet and draggled, forty secondslater. As for the Herr Lieutenant, a disappointed man, he fell out bythe way, alleging a puncture. I believe he was ashamed to admit the factthat he had been beaten in open fight by the objurgated Engl\\u00e4nderin.So the end of it was, I was now a woman of means, with fifty pounds ofmy own to my credit.I lunched with my backer royally at the best inn in Limburg.IVTHE ADVENTURE OF THE AMATEUR COMMISSION AGENTMy eccentric American had assured me that if I won the great race forhim I need not be 'skeert' lest he should fail to treat me well; and todo him justice, I must admit that he kept his word magnanimously. Whilewe sat at lunch in the cosy hotel at Limburg he counted out and paid mein hand the fifty good gold pieces he had promised me. 'Whether theseDeutschers fork out my twenty thousand marks or not,' he said, in hisbrisk way, 'it don't much matter. I shall get the contract, and I shallhev gotten the adver_tize_ment!''Why do you start your bicycles in Germany, though?' I asked,innocently. 'I should have thought myself there was so much a betterchance of selling them in England.'[Illustration: LET THEM BOOM OR BUST ON IT.]He closed one eye, and looked abstractedly at the light through hisglass of pale yellow Brauneberger with the other. 'England? Yes,England! Well, see, miss, you hev not been raised in business. Businessis business. The way to do it in Germany is--to manufacture foryourself: and I've got my works started right here in Frankfort. The wayto do it in England--where capital's dirt cheap--is, to sell your patentfor every cent it's worth to an English company, and let them boom orbust on it.''I see,' I said, catching at it. 'The principle's as clear as mud, themoment you point it out to one. An English company will pay you well forthe concession, and work for a smaller return on its investment than youAmericans are content to receive on your capital!''That's so! You hit it in one, miss! Which will you take, a cigar or acocoa-nut?'I smiled. 'And what do you think you will call the machine in Europe?'He gazed hard at me, and stroked his straw-coloured moustache. 'Well,what do _you_ think of the _Lois Cayley_?''For Heaven's sake, no!' I cried, fervently. 'Mr. Hitchcock, I imploreyou!'He smiled pity for my weakness. 'Ah, high-toned again?' he repeated, asif it were some natural malformation under which I laboured. 'Oh, ef youdon't like it, miss, we'll say no more about it. I am a gentleman, I am.What's the matter with the _Excelsior_?''Nothing, except that it's very bad Latin,' I objected.'That may be so; but it's very good business.'He paused and mused, then he murmured low to himself, '\\\"When through anAlpine village passed.\\\" That's where the idea of the _Excelsior_ comesin; see? \\\"It goes up Mont Blanc,\\\" you said yourself. \\\"Through snow andice, A cycle with the strange device, Excelsior!\\\"''If I were you,' I said, 'I would stick to the name _Manitou_. It'soriginal, and it's distinctive.''Think so? Then chalk it up; the thing's done. You may not be aware ofit, miss, but you are a lady for whose opinion in such matters I hev ahigh regard. _And_ you understand Europe. I do not. I admit it.Everything seems to me to be _verboten_ in Germany; and everything elseto be _bad form_ in England.'We walked down the steps together. 'What a picturesque old town!' Isaid, looking round me, well pleased. Its beauty appealed to me, for Ihad fifty pounds in pocket, and I had lunched sumptuously.'_Old_ town?' he repeated, gazing with a blank stare. 'You call thistown _old_, do you?''Why, of course! Just look at the cathedral! Eight hundred years old, atleast!'He ran his eye down the streets, dissatisfied.'Well, ef this town is old,' he said at last, with a snap of hisfingers, 'it's precious little for its age.' And he strode away towardsthe railway station.'What about the bicycle?' I asked; for it lay, a silent victor, againstthe railing of the steps, surrounded by a crowd of inquiring Teutons.He glanced at it carelessly. 'Oh, the wheel?' he said. 'You may keepit.'He said it so exactly in the tone in which one tells a waiter he maykeep the change, that I resented the impertinence. 'No, thank you,' Ianswered. 'I do not require it.'He gazed at me, open-mouthed. 'What? Put my foot in it again?' heinterposed. 'Not high-toned enough? Eh? Now, I do regret it. No offencemeant, miss, nor none need be taken. What I meant to in-sinuate wasthis: you hev won the big race for me. Folks will notice you and talkabout you at Frankfort. Ef you ride a Manitou, that'll make 'em talk themore. A mutual advantage. Benefits you; benefits me. You get the wheel;I get the adver_tize_ment.'I saw that reciprocity was the lodestar of his life. 'Very well, Mr.Hitchcock,' I said, pocketing my pride, 'I'll accept the machine, andI'll ride it.'Then a light dawned upon me. I saw eventualities. 'Look here,' I wenton, innocently--recollect, I was a girl just fresh from Girton--'I amthinking of going on very soon to Switzerland. Now, why shouldn't I dothis--try to sell your machines, or, rather, take orders for them, fromanybody that admires them? A mutual advantage. Benefits you; benefitsme. You sell your wheels; I get----'He stared at me. 'The commission?''I don't know what commission means,' I answered, somewhat at sea as tothe name; 'but I thought it might be worth your while, till the Manitoubecomes better known, to pay me, say, ten per cent on all orders Ibrought you.'His face was one broad smile. 'I do admire at you, miss,' he cried,standing still to inspect me. 'You may not know the meaning of the_word_ commission; but durned ef you haven't got a hang of the _thing_itself that would do honour to a Wall Street operator, anyway.''Then that's business?' I asked, eagerly; for I beheld vistas.'Business?' he repeated. 'Yes, that's jest about the size ofit--business. Adver_tize_ment, miss, may be the soul of commerce, butCommission's its body. You go in and win. Ten per cent on every orderyou send me!'He insisted on taking my ticket back to Frankfort. 'My affair, miss; myaffair!' There was no gainsaying him. He was immensely elated. 'Thebiggest thing in cycles since Dunlop tyres,' he repeated. 'Andto-morrow, they'll give me advertizements gratis in every newspaper!'Next morning, he came round to call on me at the Abode of UnclaimedDomestic Angels. He was explicit and generous. 'Look here, miss,' hebegan; 'I didn't do fair by you when you interviewed me about youragency last evening. I took advantage, _at_ the time, _of_ your youthand inexperience. You suggested 10 per cent _as_ the amount of yourcommission on sales you might effect; and I jumped at it. That wasconduct unworthy _of_ a gentleman. Now, I will not deceive you. Theordinary commission on transactions in wheels is 25 per cent. I am goingto sell the Manitou retail at twenty English pounds apiece. You shallhev your 25 per cent on all orders.''Five pounds for every machine I sell?' I exclaimed, overjoyed.He nodded. 'That's so.'I was simply amazed at this magnificent prospect. 'The cycle trade mustbe honeycombed with middlemen's profits!' I cried; for I had mymisgivings.'That's so,' he replied again. 'Then jest you take and be amiddlewoman.''But, as a consistent socialist----''It is your duty to fleece the capitalist and the consumer. A mutualbenefit--triangular this time. I get the order, the public gets themachine, and you get the commission. I am richer, you are richer, andthe public is mounted on much the best wheel ever yet invented.''That sounds plausible,' I admitted. 'I shall try it on in Switzerland.I shall run up steep hills whenever I see any likely customers lookingon; then I shall stop and ask them the time, as if quite accidentally.'He rubbed his hands. 'You take to business like a young duck to thewater,' he exclaimed, admiringly. 'That's the way to rake 'em in! You goup and say to them, \\\"Why not investigate? We defy competition. Leave thedrudgery of walking uphill beside your cycle! Progress is the order ofthe day. Use modern methods! This is the age of the telegraph, thetelephone, _and_ the typewriter. You kin no longer afford to go on withan antiquated, ante-diluvian, armour-plated wheel. Invest in aHill-Climber, the last and lightest product of evvolootion. _Is_ itcommon-sense to buy an old-style, unautomatic, single-geared,inconvertible ten-ton machine, when for the same money or less you canpurchase the self-acting Manitou, a priceless gem, as light as afeather, with all the most recent additions and improvements? Bereasonable! Get the best!\\\" That's the style to fetch 'em!'I laughed, in spite of myself. 'Oh, Mr. Hitchcock,' I burst out, 'that'snot _my_ style at all. I shall say, simply \\\"This is a lovely newbicycle. You can see for yourself how it climbs hills. Try it, if youwish. It skims like a swallow. And I get what they call five poundscommission on every one I can sell of them!\\\" I think that way of dealingis much more likely to bring you in orders.'His admiration was undisguised. 'Well, I _do_ call you a woman ofbusiness, miss,' he cried. 'You see it at a glance. That's so. That'sthe right kind of thing to rope in the Europeans. Some originality aboutyou. You take 'em on their own ground. You've got the draw on them, youhev. I like your system. You'll jest haul in the dollars!''I hope so,' I said, fervently; for I had evolved in my own mind, oh,such a _lovely_ scheme for Elsie Petheridge's holidays!He gazed at me once more. 'Ef only I could get hold of a woman ofbusiness like you to soar through life with me,' he murmured.[Illustration: HIS OPEN ADMIRATION WAS GETTING QUITE EMBARRASSING.]I grew interested in my shoes. His open admiration was getting quiteembarrassing.He paused a minute. Then he went on: 'Well, what do you say to it?''To what?' I asked, amazed.'To my proposition--my offer.''I-- I don't understand,' I stammered out bewildered. 'The 25 per cent,you mean?''No, the de-votion of a lifetime,' he answered, looking sideways at me.'Miss Cayley, when a business man advances a proposition, commercial orotherwise, he advances it because he means it. He asks a prompt reply.Your time is valuable. So is mine. _Are_ you prepared to consider it?''Mr. Hitchcock,' I said, drawing back, 'I think you misunderstand. Ithink you do not realise----''All right, miss,' he answered, promptly, though with a disappointedair. 'Ef it kin not be managed, it kin not be managed. I understand yourEuropean ex-clusiveness. I know your prejudices. But this little episodeneed not antagonise with the normal course of ordinary business. Irespect you, Miss Cayley. You are a lady _of_ intelligence, _of_initiative, and _of_ high-toned culture. I will wish you good day forthe present, without further words; and I shall be happy at any time toreceive your orders on the usual commission.'He backed out and was gone. He was so honestly blunt that I really quiteliked him.Next day, I bade a tearless farewell to the Blighted Fraus. When I toldthose eight phlegmatic souls I was going, they all said 'So!' much asthey had said 'So!' to every previous remark I had been moved to maketo them. 'So' is capital garnishing: but viewed as a staple ofconversation, I find it a trifle vapid, not to say monotonous.I set out on my wanderings, therefore, to go round the world on my ownaccount and my own Manitou, which last I grew to love in time with alove passing the love of Mr. Cyrus Hitchcock. I carried the strictnecessary before me in a small waterproof bicycling valise; but I senton the portmanteau containing my whole estate, real or personal, to somepoint in advance which I hoped to reach from time to time in a day ortwo. My first day's journey was along a pleasant road from Frankfort toHeidelberg, some fifty-four miles in all, skirting the mountains thegreater part of the way; the Manitou took the ups and downs so easilythat I diverged at intervals, to choose side-paths over the woodedhills. I arrived at Heidelberg as fresh as a daisy, my mount not havingturned a hair meanwhile--a favourite expression of cyclists whichcarries all the more conviction to an impartial mind because of themachine being obviously hairless. Thence I journeyed on by easy stagesto Karlsruhe, Baden, Appenweier, and Offenburg; where I set my frontwheel resolutely for the Black Forest. It is the prettiest and mostpicturesque route to Switzerland; and, being also the hilliest, it wouldafford me, I thought, the best opportunity for showing off the Manitou'spaces, and trying my prentice hand as an amateur cycle-agent.From the quaint little Black Eagle at Offenburg, however, before Idashed into the Forest, I sent off a letter to Elsie Petheridge, settingforth my lovely scheme for her summer holidays. She was delicate, poorchild, and the London winters sorely tried her; I was now a millionaire,with the better part of fifty pounds in pocket, so I felt I could affordto be royal in my hospitality. As I was leaving Frankfort, I had calledat a tourist agency and bought a second-class circular ticket fromLondon to Lucerne and back-- I made it second-class because I am opposedon principle to excessive luxury, and also because it was three guineascheaper. Even fifty pounds will not last for ever, though I could scarcebelieve it. (You see, I am not wholly free, after all, from thebesetting British vice of prudence.) It was a mighty joy to me to beable to send this ticket to Elsie, at her lodgings in Bayswater,pointing out to her that now the whole mischief was done, and that ifshe would not come out as soon as her summer vacation began--'twas apoint of honour with Elsie to say _vacation_, instead of _holidays_--tojoin me at Lucerne, and stop with me as my guest at a mountain_pension_, the ticket would be wasted. I love burning my boats; 'tis theonly safe way for securing prompt action.Then I turned my flying wheels up into the Black Forest, growing wearyof my loneliness--for it is not all jam to ride by oneself inGermany--and longing for Elsie to come out and join me. I loved to thinkhow her dear pale cheeks would gain colour and tone on the hills aboutthe Br\\u00fcnig, where, for business reasons (so I said to myself with theconscious pride of the commission agent), I proposed to pass the greaterpart of the summer.From Offenburg to Hornberg the road makes a good stiff climb oftwenty-seven miles, and some 1200 English feet in altitude, with a fairnumber of minor undulations on the way to diversify it. I will notdescribe the route, though it is one of the most beautiful I have evertravelled--rocky hills, ruined castles, huge, straight-stemmed pinesthat clamber up green slopes, or halt in sombre line against steeps ofbroken crag; the reality surpasses my poor powers of description. Andthe people I passed on the road were almost as quaint and picturesquein their way as the hills and the villages--the men in red-linedjackets; the women in black petticoats, short-waisted green bodices, andbroad-brimmed straw hats with black-and-crimson pompons. But on thesteepest gradient, just before reaching Hornberg, I got my firstnibble--strange to say, from two German students; they wore Heidelbergcaps, and were toiling up the incline with short, broken wind; I put ona spurt with the Manitou, and passed them easily. I did it just at firstin pure wantonness of health and strength; but the moment I was clear ofthem, it occurred to the business half of me that here was a good chanceof taking an order. Filled with this bright idea, I dismounted near thesummit, and pretended to be engaged in lubricating my bearings; thoughas a matter of fact the Manitou runs in a bath of oil, self-feeding, andneeds no looking after. Presently, my two Heidelbergers straggledup--hot, dusty, panting. Woman-like, I pretended to take no notice. Oneof them drew near and cast an eye on the Manitou.'That's a new machine, Fr\\u00e4ulein,' he said, at last, with more politenessthan I expected.'It is,' I answered, casually; 'the latest model. Climbs hills like noother.' And I feigned to mount and glide off towards Hornberg.'Stop a moment, pray, Fr\\u00e4ulein,' my prospective buyer called out. 'Here,Heinrich, I wish you this new so excellent mountain-climbing machine,without chain propelled, more fully to investigate.''I am going on to Hornberg,' I said, with mixed feminine guile andcommercial strategy; 'still, if your friend wishes to look----'[Illustration: MINUTE INSPECTION.]They both jostled round it, with _achs_ innumerable, and, after minuteinspection, pronounced its principle _wundersch\\u00f6n_. 'Might I essay it?'Heinrich asked.'Oh, by all means,' I answered. He paced it down hill a few yards; thenskimmed up again.'It is a bird!' he cried to his friend, with many gutturalinterjections. 'Like the eagle's flight, so soars it. Come, try thething, Ludwig!''You permit, Fr\\u00e4ulein?'I nodded. They both mounted it several times. It behaved like a beauty.Then one of them asked, 'And where can man of this new so remarkablemachine nearest by purchase himself make possessor?''I am the Sole Agent,' I burst out, with swelling dignity. 'If you willgive me your orders, with cash in hand for the amount, I will send thecycle, carriage paid, to any address you desire in Germany.''You!' they exclaimed, incredulously. 'The Fr\\u00e4ulein is pleased to behumorous!''Oh, very well,' I answered, vaulting into the saddle; 'If you choose todoubt my word----' I waved one careless hand and coasted off.'Good-morning, meine Herren.'They lumbered after me on their ramshackled traction-engines. 'Pardon,Fr\\u00e4ulein! Do not thus go away! Oblige us at least with the name andaddress of the maker.'I perpended--like the Herr Over-Superintendent at Frankfort. 'Lookhere,' I said at last, telling the truth with frankness, 'I get 25 percent on all bicycles I sell. I am, as I say, the maker's Sole Agent. Ifyou order through me, I touch my profit; if otherwise, I do not. Still,since you seem to be gentlemen,' they bowed and swelled visibly, 'I willgive you the address of the firm, trusting to your honour to mention myname'--I handed them a card--'if you decide on ordering. The price ofthe palfrey is 400 marks. It is worth every pfennig of it.' And beforethey could say more, I had spurred my steed and swept off at full speedround a curve of the highway.I pencilled a note to my American that night from Hornberg, detailingthe circumstance; but I am sorry to say, for the discredit of humanity,that when those two students wrote the same evening from their inn inthe village to order Manitous, they did _not_ mention my name, doubtlessunder the misconception that by suppressing it they would save mycommission. However, it gives me pleasure to add _per contra_ (as we sayin business) that when I arrived at Lucerne a week or so later I found aletter, _poste restante_, from Mr. Cyrus Hitchcock, inclosing an Englishten-pound note. He wrote that he had received two orders for Manitousfrom Hornberg; and 'feeling considerable confidence that these mustnecessarily originate' from my German students, he had the pleasure offorwarding me what he hoped would be the first of many similarcommissions.[Illustration: FELT A PERFECT LITTLE HYPOCRITE.]I will not describe my further adventures on the still steeper mountainroad from Hornberg to Triberg and St. Georgen--how I got bites on theway from an English curate, an Austrian hussar, and two unprotectedAmerican ladies; nor how I angled for them all by riding my machine upimpossible hills, and then reclining gracefully to eat my lunch (threetimes in one day) on mossy banks at the summit. I felt a perfect littlehypocrite. But Mr. Hitchcock had remarked that business is business; andI will only add (in confirmation of his view) that by the time I reachedLucerne, I had sown the good seed in fifteen separate human souls, noless than four of which brought forth fruit in orders for Manitousbefore the end of the season.I had now so little fear what the morrow might bring forth that Isettled down in a comfortable hotel at Lucerne till Elsie's holidaysbegan; and amused myself meanwhile by picking out the hilliest roads Icould find in the neighbourhood, in order to display my steel steed'spossibilities to the best advantage.By the end of July, Elsie joined me. She was half-angry at first that Ishould have forced the ticket and my hospitality upon her.'Nonsense, dear,' I said, smoothing her hair, for her pale face quitefrightened me. 'What is the good of a friend if she will not allow youto do her little favours?''But, Brownie, you said you wouldn't stop and be dependent upon _me_ oneday longer than was necessary in London.''That was different,' I cried. 'That was Me! This is You! I am a great,strong, healthy thing, fit to fight the battle of life and take care ofmyself; you, Elsie, are one of those fragile little flowers which 'tiseverybody's duty to protect and to care for.'She would have protested more; but I stifled her mouth with kisses.Indeed, for nothing did I rejoice in my prosperity so much as for thechance it gave me of helping poor dear overworked, overwrought Elsie.We took up our quarters thenceforth at a high-perched little guest-housenear the top of the Br\\u00fcnig. It was bracing for Elsie; and it lay closeto a tourist track where I could spread my snares and exhibit theManitou in its true colours to many passing visitors. Elsie tried it,and found she could ride on it with ease. She wished she had one of herown. A bright idea struck me. In fear and trembling, I wrote, suggestingto Mr. Hitchcock that I had a girl friend from England stopping with mein Switzerland, and that two Manitous would surely be better than one asan adver_tize_ment. I confess I stood aghast at my own cheek; but myhand, I fear, was rapidly growing 'subdued to that it worked in.' AnyhowI sent the letter off, and waited developments.By return of post came an answer from my American.     'DEAR MISS--By rail herewith please receive one lady's No. 4     automatic quadruple-geared self-feeding Manitou, as per your     esteemed favour of July 27th, for which I desire to thank you. The     more I see of your way of doing business, the more I do admire at     you. This is an elegant poster! Two high-toned English ladies,     mounted on Manitous, careering up the Alps, represent to both of     us quite a mint of money. The mutual benefit, to me, to you, and     to the other lady, ought to be simply incalculable. I shall be     pleased at any time to hear of any further developments of your     very remarkable advertising skill, and I am obliged to you for     this brilliant suggestion you have been good enough to make to     me.--Respectfully,  'CYRUS W. HITCHCOCK.''What? Am I to have it for nothing, Brownie?' Elsie exclaimed,bewildered, when I read the letter to her.I assumed the airs of a woman of the world. 'Why, certainly, my dear,' Ianswered, as if I always expected to find bicycles showered upon me.'It's a mutual arrangement. Benefits him; benefits you. Reciprocity isthe groundwork of business. _He_ gets the advertisement; _you_ get theamusement. It's a form of handbill. Like the ladies who exhibit theirback hair, don't you know, in that window in Regent Street.'Thus inexpensively mounted, we scoured the country together, up thesteepest hills between Stanzstadt and Meiringen. We had lots of nibbles.One lady in particular often stopped to look on and admire the Manitou.She was a nice-looking widow of forty-five, very fresh and round-faced;a Mrs. Evelegh, we soon found out, who owned a charming _chalet_ on thehills above Lungern. She spoke to us more than once: 'What a perfectdear of a machine!' she cried. 'I wonder if I dare try it!''Can you cycle?' I asked.'I could once,' she answered. 'I was awfully fond of it. But Dr.Fortescue-Langley won't let me any longer.''Try it!' I said dismounting. She got up and rode. 'Oh, isn't it justlovely!' she cried ecstatically.'Buy one!' I put in. 'They're as smooth as silk; they cost only twentypounds; and, on every machine I sell, I get five pounds commission.''I should love to,' she answered; 'but Dr. Fortescue-Langley----''Who is he?' I asked. 'I don't believe in drug-drenchers.'She looked quite shocked. 'Oh, he's not that kind, you know,' she putin, breathlessly. 'He's the celebrated esoteric faith-healer. He won'tlet me move far away from Lungern, though I'm longing to be off toEngland again for the summer. My boy's at Portsmouth.''Then, why don't you disobey him?'Her face was a study. 'I daren't,' she answered in an awe-struck voice.'He comes here every summer; and he does me _so_ much good, you know. Hediagnoses my inner self. He treats me psychically. When my inner selfgoes wrong, my bangle turns dusky.' She held up her right hand with anIndian silver bangle on it; and sure enough, it was tarnished with avery thin black deposit. 'My soul is ailing now,' she said in acomically serious voice. 'But it is seldom so in Switzerland. The momentI land in England the bangle turns black and remains black till I getback to Lucerne again.'When she had gone, I said to Elsie, 'That _is_ odd about the bangle.State of health might affect it, I suppose. Though it looks to me like asurface deposit of sulphide.' I knew nothing of chemistry, I admit; butI had sometimes messed about in the laboratory at college with some ofthe other girls; and I remembered now that sulphide of silver was ablackish-looking body, like the film on the bangle.However, at the time I thought no more about it.[Illustration: SHE INVITED ELSIE AND MYSELF TO STOP WITH HER.]By dint of stopping and talking, we soon got quite intimate with Mrs.Evelegh. As always happens, I found out I had known some of her cousinsin Edinburgh, where I always spent my holidays while I was at Girton.She took an interest in what she was kind enough to call myoriginality; and before a fortnight was out, our hotel beinguncomfortably crowded, she had invited Elsie and myself to stop with herat the _chalet_. We went, and found it a delightful little home. Mrs.Evelegh was charming; but we could see at every turn that Dr.Fortescue-Langley had acquired a firm hold over her. 'He's so clever,you know,' she said; 'and so spiritual! He exercises such strong odylicforce. He binds my being together. If he misses a visit, I feel my innerself goes all to pieces.''Does he come often?' I asked, growing interested.'Oh, dear, no,' she answered. 'I wish he did: it would be ever so goodfor me. But he's so much run after; I am but one among many. He lives atCh\\u00e2teau d'Oex, and comes across to see patients in this district once afortnight. It is a privilege to be attended by an intuitive seer likeDr. Fortescue-Langley.'Mrs. Evelegh was rich--'left comfortably,' as the phrase goes, but witha clause which prevented her marrying again without losing her fortune;and I could gather from various hints that Dr. Fortescue-Langley,whoever he might be, was bleeding her to some tune, using her soul andher inner self as his financial lancet. I also noticed that what shesaid about the bangle was strictly true; generally bright as a new pin,on certain mornings it was completely blackened. I had been at the_chalet_ ten days, however, before I began to suspect the real reason.Then it dawned upon me one morning in a flash of inspiration. Theevening before had been cold, for at the height where we were perched,even in August, we often found the temperature chilly in the night, andI heard Mrs. Evelegh tell C\\u00e9cile, her maid, to fill the hot-waterbottle. It was a small point, but it somehow went home to me. Next daythe bangle was black, and Mrs. Evelegh lamented that her inner self mustbe suffering from an attack of evil vapours.I held my peace at the time, but I asked C\\u00e9cile a little later to bringme that hot-water-bottle. As I more than half suspected, it was made ofindia-rubber, wrapped carefully up in the usual red flannel bag. 'Lendme your brooch, Elsie,' I said. 'I want to try a little experiment.''Won't a franc do as well?' Elsie asked, tendering one. 'That's equallysilver.''I think not,' I answered. 'A franc is most likely too hard; it has basemetal to alloy it. But I will vary the experiment by trying bothtogether. Your brooch is Indian and therefore soft silver. The nativejewellers never use alloy. Hand it over; it will clean with a littleplate-powder, if necessary. I'm going to see what blackens Mrs.Evelegh's bangle.'I laid the franc and the brooch on the bottle, filled with hot water,and placed them for warmth in the fold of a blanket. After _d\\u00e9je\\u00fbner_,we inspected them. As I anticipated, the brooch had grown black on thesurface with a thin iridescent layer of silver sulphide, while the franchad hardly suffered at all from the exposure.I called in Mrs. Evelegh, and explained what I had done. She wasastonished and half incredulous. 'How could you ever think of it?' shecried, admiringly.'Why, I was reading an article yesterday about india-rubber in one ofyour magazines,' I answered; 'and the person who wrote it said the rawgum was hardened for vulcanising by mixing it with sulphur. When I heardyou ask C\\u00e9cile for the hot-water-bottle, I thought at once: \\\"The sulphurand the heat account for the tarnishing of Mrs. Evelegh's bangle.\\\"''And the franc doesn't tarnish! Then that must be why my other silverbracelet, which is English make, and harder, never changes colour! AndDr. Fortescue-Langley assured me it was because the soft one was ofIndian metal, and had mystic symbols on it--symbols that answered to thecardinal moods of my sub-conscious self, and that darkened in sympathy.'I jumped at a clue. 'He talked about your sub-conscious self?' I brokein.'Yes,' she answered. 'He always does. It's the key-note of his system.He heals by that alone. But, my dear, after this, how can I ever believein him?''Does he know about the hot-water-bottle?' I asked.'Oh, yes; he ordered me to use it on certain nights; and when I go toEngland he says I must never be without one. I see now that was why myinner self invariably went wrong in England. It was all just the sulphurblackening the bangles.'I reflected. 'A middle-aged man?' I asked. 'Stout, diplomatic-looking,with wrinkles round his eyes, and a distinguished grey moustache,twirled up oddly at the corners?''That's the man, my dear! His very picture. Where on earth have you seenhim?''And he talks of sub-conscious selves?' I went on.'He practises on that basis. He says it's no use prescribing for theouter man; to do that is to treat mere symptoms: the sub-conscious selfis the inner seat of diseases.''How long has he been in Switzerland?''Oh, he comes here every year. He arrived this season late in May, Ifancy.''When will he visit you again, Mrs. Evelegh?''To-morrow morning.'I made up my mind at once. 'Then I must see him, without being seen,' Isaid. 'I think I know him. He is our Count, I believe.' For I had toldMrs. Evelegh and Elsie the queer story of my journey from London.'Impossible, my dear! Im-possible! I have implicit faith in him!''Wait and see, Mrs. Evelegh. You acknowledge he duped you over theaffair of the bangle.'[Illustration: THE COUNT.]There are two kinds of dupe: one kind, the commonest, goes on believingin its deceiver, no matter what happens; the other, far rarer, has thesense to know it has been deceived if you make the deception as clear asday to it. Mrs. Evelegh was, fortunately, of the rarer class. Nextmorning, Dr. Fortescue-Langley arrived, by appointment. As he walked upthe path, I glanced at him from my window. It was the Count, not a doubtof it. On his way to gull his dupes in Switzerland, he had tried tothrow in an incidental trifle of a diamond robbery.I telegraphed the facts at once to Lady Georgina, at Schlangenbad. Sheanswered, 'I am coming. Ask the man to meet his friend on Wednesday.'Mrs. Evelegh, now almost convinced, invited him. On Wednesday morning,with a bounce, Lady Georgina burst in upon us. 'My dear, such ajourney!--alone, at my age--but there, I haven't known a happy day sinceyou left me! Oh, yes, I got my Gretchen--unsophisticated?--well--h'm--that's not the word for it: I declare to you, Lois, thereisn't a trick of the trade, in Paris or London--not a perquisite or atip that that girl isn't up to. Comes straight from the remotestrecesses of the Black Forest, and hadn't been with me a week, I assureyou, honour bright, before she was bandolining her yellow hair, androuging her cheeks, and wearing my brooches, and wagering gloves withthe hotel waiters upon the Baden races. _And_ her language: _and_ hermanners! Why weren't you born in that station of life, I wonder, child,so that I might offer you five hundred a year, and all found, to comeand live with me for ever? But this Gretchen--her fringe, her shoes, herribbons--upon my soul, my dear, I don't know what girls are coming tonowadays.''Ask Mrs. Lynn-Linton,' I suggested, as she paused. 'She is a recognisedauthority on the subject.'The Cantankerous Old Lady stared at me. 'And this Count?' she went on.'So you have really tracked him? You're a wonderful girl, my dear. Iwish you were a lady's maid. You'd be worth me any money.'I explained how I had come to hear of Dr. Fortescue-Langley.Lady Georgina waxed warm. 'Dr. Fortescue-Langley!' she exclaimed. 'Thewicked wretch! But he didn't get my diamonds! I've carried them here inmy hands, all the way from Wiesbaden: I wasn't going to leave them fora single day to the tender mercies of that unspeakable Gretchen. Thefool would lose them. Well, we'll catch him this time, Lois: and we'llgive him ten years for it!''Ten years!' Mrs. Evelegh cried, clasping her hands in horror. 'Oh, LadyGeorgina!'We waited in Mrs. Evelegh's dining-room, the old lady and I, behind thefolding doors. At three precisely Dr. Fortescue-Langley walked in. I haddifficulty in restraining Lady Georgina from falling upon himprematurely. He talked a lot of high-flown nonsense to Mrs. Evelegh andElsie about the influences of the planets, and the seventy-fiveemanations, and the eternal wisdom of the East, and the medical efficacyof sub-conscious suggestion. Excellent patter, all of it--quite as goodin its way as the diplomatic patter he had poured forth in the train toLady Georgina. It was rich in spheres, in elements, in cosmic forces. Atlast, as he was discussing the reciprocal action of the inner self uponthe exhalations of the lungs, we pushed back the door and walked calmlyin upon him.His breath came and went. The exhalations of the lungs showed visibleperturbation. He rose and stared at us. For a second he lost hiscomposure. Then, as bold as brass, he turned, with a cunning smile, toMrs. Evelegh. 'Where on earth did you pick up such acquaintances?' heinquired, in a well-simulated tone of surprise. 'Yes, Lady Georgina, Ihave met you before, I admit; but--it can hardly be agreeable to you toreflect under what circumstances.'Lady Georgina was beside herself. 'You dare?' she cried, confrontinghim. 'You dare to brazen it out? You miserable sneak! But you can'tbluff me now. I have the police outside.' Which I regret to confess wasa light-hearted fiction.'The police?' he echoed, drawing back. I could see he was frightened.I had an inspiration again. 'Take off that moustache!' I said, calmly,in my most commanding voice.[Illustration: I THOUGHT IT KINDER TO HIM TO REMOVE IT ALTOGETHER.]He clapped his hand to it in horror. In his agitation, he managed topull it a little bit awry. It looked so absurd, hanging there, allcrooked, that I thought it kinder to him to remove it altogether. Thething peeled off with difficulty; for it was a work of art, very firmlyand gracefully fastened with sticking-plaster. But it peeled off atlast--and with it the whole of the Count's and Dr. Fortescue-Langley'sdistinction. The man stood revealed, a very palpable man-servant.Lady Georgina stared hard at him. 'Where have I seen you before?' shemurmured, slowly. 'That face is familiar to me. Why, yes; you went onceto Italy as Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's courier! I know you now. Your nameis Higginson.'It was a come-down for the Comte de Laroche-sur-Loiret, but he swallowedit like a man at a single gulp.'Yes, my lady,' he said, fingering his hat nervously, now all was up.'You are quite right, my lady. But what would you have me do? Times arehard on us couriers. Nobody wants us now. I must take to what I can.' Heassumed once more the tone of the Vienna diplomat. '_Que voulez-vous_,madame? These are revolutionary days. A man of intelligence must movewith the Zeitgeist!'Lady Georgina burst into a loud laugh. 'And to think,' she cried, 'thatI talked to this lackey from London to Malines without ever suspectinghim! Higginson, you're a fraud--but you're a precious clever one.'He bowed. 'I am happy to have merited Lady Georgina Fawley'scommendation,' he answered, with his palm on his heart, in his grandiosemanner.'But I shall hand you over to the police all the same! You are a thiefand a swindler!'He assumed a comic expression. 'Unhappily, not a thief,' he objected.'This young lady prevented me from appropriating your diamonds._Convey_, the wise call it. I wanted to take your jewel-case--and sheput me off with a sandwich-tin. I wanted to make an honest penny out ofMrs. Evelegh; and--she confronts me with your ladyship, and tears mymoustache off.'Lady Georgina regarded him with a hesitating expression. 'But I shallcall the police,' she said, wavering visibly.'_De grace_, my lady, _de grace_! Is it worth while, _pour si peu dechose_? Consider, I have really effected nothing. Will you charge mewith having taken--in error--a small tin sandwich-case--value,elevenpence? An affair of a week's imprisonment. That is positively allyou can bring up against me. And,' brightening up visibly, 'I have thecase still; I will return it to-morrow with pleasure to your ladyship!''But the india-rubber water-bottle?' I put in. 'You have been deceivingMrs. Evelegh. It blackens silver. And you told her lies in order toextort money under false pretences.'He shrugged his shoulders. 'You are too clever for me, young lady,' hebroke out. 'I have nothing to say to you. But Lady Georgina, Mrs.Evelegh--you are human--let me go! Reflect; I have things I could tellthat would make both of you look ridiculous. That journey to Malines,Lady Georgina! Those Indian charms, Mrs. Evelegh! Besides, you havespoiled my game. Let that suffice you! I can practise in Switzerland nolonger. Allow me to go in peace, and I will try once more to beindifferent honest!'[Illustration: INCH BY INCH HE RETREATED.]He backed slowly towards the door, with his eyes fixed on them. I stoodby and waited. Inch by inch he retreated. Lady Georgina looked downabstractedly at the carpet. Mrs. Evelegh looked up abstractedly at theceiling. Neither spoke another word. The rogue backed out by degrees.Then he sprang downstairs, and before they could decide was well outinto the open.Lady Georgina was the first to break the silence. 'After all, my dear,'she murmured, turning to me, 'there was a deal of sound Englishcommon-sense about Dogberry!'I remembered then his charge to the watch to apprehend a rogue. 'How if'a will not stand?''Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently call therest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.' WhenI remembered how Lady Georgina had hob-nobbed with the Count from Ostendto Malines, I agreed to a great extent both with her and with Dogberry.VTHE ADVENTURE OF THE IMPROMPTU MOUNTAINEERThe explosion and evaporation of Dr. Fortescue-Langley (with whom wereamalgamated the Comte de Laroche-sur-Loiret, Mr. Higginson the courier,and whatever else that versatile gentleman chose to call himself)entailed many results of varying magnitudes.In the first place, Mrs. Evelegh ordered a Great Manitou. That, however,mattered little to 'the firm,' as I loved to call us (because it shockeddear Elsie so); for, of course, after all her kindness we couldn'taccept our commission on her purchase, so that she got her machine cheapfor \\u00a315 from the maker. But, in the second place--I declare I ambeginning to write like a woman of business--she decided to run over toEngland for the summer to see her boy at Portsmouth, being certain nowthat the discoloration of her bangle depended more on the presence ofsulphur in the india-rubber bottle than on the passing state of herastral body. 'Tis an abrupt descent from the inner self to a hot-waterbottle, I admit; but Mrs. Evelegh took the plunge with grace, like asensible woman. Dr. Fortescue-Langley had been annihilated for her atone blow: she returned forthwith to common-sense and England.'What will you do with the _chalet_ while you're away?' Lady Georginaasked, when she announced her intention. 'You can't shut it up to takecare of itself. Every blessed thing in the place will go to rack andruin. Shutting up a house means spoiling it for ever. Why, I've got acottage of my own that I let for the summer in the best part ofSurrey--a pretty little place, now vacant, for which, by the way, I wanta tenant, if you happen to know of one: and when it's left empty for amonth or two----''Perhaps it would do for me?' Mrs. Evelegh suggested, jumping at it.'I'm looking out for a furnished house for the summer, within easy reachof Portsmouth and London, for myself and Oliver.'Lady Georgina seized her arm, with a face of blank horror. 'My dear,'she cried. 'For you! I wouldn't dream of letting it to you. A nasty,damp, cold, unwholesome house, on stiff clay soil, with detestabledrains, in the deadliest part of the Weald of Surrey,--why, you and yourboy would catch your deaths of rheumatism.''Is it the one I saw advertised in the _Times_ this morning, I wonder?'Mrs. Evelegh inquired in a placid voice. '\\\"Charming furnished house onHolmesdale Common; six bedrooms, four reception-rooms; splendid views;pure air; picturesque surroundings; exceptionally situated.\\\" I thoughtof writing about it.'[Illustration: NEVER LEAVE A HOUSE TO THE SERVANTS, MY DEAR!]'That's it!' Lady Georgina exclaimed, with a demonstrative wave of herhand. 'I drew up the advertisement myself. Exceptionally situated! Ishould just think it was! Why, my dear, I wouldn't let you rent theplace for worlds; a horrid, poky little hole, stuck down in the bottomof a boggy hollow, as damp as Devonshire, with the paper peeling off thewalls, so that I had to take my choice between giving it up myself tenyears ago, or removing to the cemetery; and I've let it ever since toCity men with large families. Nothing would induce me to allow you andyour boy to expose yourself to such risks.' For Lady Georgina had takenquite a fancy to Mrs. Evelegh. 'But what I was just going to say wasthis: you can't shut your house up; it'll all go mouldy. Houses alwaysgo mouldy, shut up in summer. And you can't leave it to your servants;_I_ know the baggages; no conscience--no conscience; they'll ask theirentire families to come and stop with them _en bloc_, and turn yourplace into a perfect piggery. Why, when I went away from my house intown one autumn, didn't I leave a policeman and his wife in charge--amost respectable man--only he happened to be an Irishman. And what wasthe consequence? My dear, I assure you, I came back unexpectedly frompoor dear Kynaston's one day--at a moment's notice--having quarrelledwith him over Home Rule or Education or something--poor dear Kynaston'swhat they call a Liberal, I believe--got at by that man Rosebery--andthere didn't I find all the O'Flanagans, and O'Flahertys, and O'Flynnsin the neighbourhood camping out in my drawing-room; with a strongdetachment of O'Donohues, and O'Dohertys, and O'Driscolls lying aroundloose in possession of the library? Never leave a house to the servants,my dear! It's positively suicidal. Put in a responsible caretaker ofwhom you know something--like Lois here, for instance.''Lois!' Mrs. Evelegh echoed. 'Dear me, that's just the very thing. Whata capital idea! I never thought of Lois! She and Elsie might stop onhere, with Ursula and the gardener.'I protested that if we did it was our clear duty to pay a small rent;but Mrs. Evelegh brushed that aside. 'You've robbed yourselves over thebicycle,' she insisted, 'and I'm delighted to let you have it. It's Iwho ought to pay, for you'll keep the house dry for me.'I remembered Mr. Hitchcock--'Mutual advantage: benefits you, benefitsme'--and made no bones about it. So in the end Mrs. Evelegh set off forEngland with C\\u00e9cile, leaving Elsie and me in charge of Ursula, thegardener, and the _chalet_.As for Lady Georgina, having by this time completed her 'cure' atSchlangenbad (complexion as usual; no guinea yellower), she telegraphedfor Gretchen--'I can't do without the idiot'--and hung round Lucerne,apparently for no other purpose but to send people up the Br\\u00fcnig on thehunt for our wonderful new machines, and so put money in our pockets.She was much amused when I told her that Aunt Susan (who lived, you willremember, in respectable indigence at Blackheath) had written toexpostulate with me on my 'unladylike' conduct in becoming a bicyclecommission agent. 'Unladylike!--the Cantankerous Old Lady exclaimed,with warmth. 'What does the woman mean? Has she got no gumption? It's\\\"ladylike,\\\" I suppose, to be a companion, or a governess, or amusic-teacher, or something else in the black-thread-glove way, inLondon; but not to sell bicycles for a good round commission. My dear,between you and me, I don't see it. If you had a brother, now, _he_might sell cycles, or corner wheat, or rig the share market, or doanything else he pleased, in these days, and nobody'd think the worse ofhim--as long as he made money; and it's my opinion that what is saucefor the goose can't be far out for the gander--and _vice-vers\\u00e2_. Besideswhich, what's the use of _trying_ to be ladylike? You _are_ a lady,child, and you couldn't help being one; why trouble to be _like_ whatnature made you? Tell Aunt Susan from me to put _that_ in her pipe andsmoke it!'I _did_ tell Aunt Susan by letter, giving Lady Georgina's authority forthe statement; and I really believe it had a consoling effect upon her;for Aunt Susan is one of those innocent-minded people who cherish aprofound respect for the opinions and ideas of a Lady of Title.Especially where questions of delicacy are concerned. It calmed her tothink that though I, an officer's daughter, had declined upon trade, Iwas mixing at least with the Best People!We had a lovely time at the _chalet_--two girls alone, messing just aswe pleased in the kitchen, and learning from Ursula how to concoct_pot-au-feu_ in the most approved Swiss fashion. We pottered, as wewomen love to potter, half the day long; the other half we spent inriding our cycles about the eternal hills, and ensnaring the flies whomLady Georgina dutifully sent up to us. She was our decoy duck: and, invirtue of her handle, she decoyed to a marvel. Indeed, I sold so manyManitous that I began to entertain a deep respect for my own commercialfaculties. As for Mr. Cyrus W. Hitchcock, he wrote to me from Frankfort:'The world continues to revolve on its axis, the Manitou, and themachine is booming. Orders romp in daily. When you ventilated thesuggestion of an agency at Limburg, I concluded at a glance you had thematerial of a first-class business woman about you; but I reckon I didnot know what a traveller meant till you started on the road. I am nowenlarging and altering this factory, to meet increased demands. Branchoffices at Berlin, Hamburg, Crefeld, and D\\u00fcsseldorf. Inspect our stockbefore dealing elsewhere. A liberal discount allowed to the trade. Twohundred agents wanted in all towns of Germany. If they were every one ofthem like _you_, miss--well, I guess I would hire the town of Frankfortfor my business premises.'One morning, after we had spent about a week at the _chalet_ byourselves, I was surprised to see a young man with a knapsack on hisback walking up the garden path towards our cottage. 'Quick, quick,Elsie!' I cried, being in a mischievous mood. 'Come here with theopera-glass! There's a Man in the offing!''A _what_?' Elsie exclaimed, shocked as usual at my levity.'A Man,' I answered, squeezing her arm. 'A Man! A real live Man! Aspecimen of the masculine gender in the human being! Man, ahoy! He hascome at last--the lodestar of our existence!'Next minute, I was sorry I spoke; for as the man drew nearer, Iperceived that he was endowed with very long legs and a languidlypoetical bearing. That supercilious smile--that enticing moustache!Could it be?--yes, it was--not a doubt of it--Harold Tillington!I grew grave at once; Harold Tillington and the situation were serious.'What can he want here?' I exclaimed, drawing back.'Who is it?' Elsie asked; for, being a woman, she read at once in myaltered demeanour the fact that the Man was not unknown to me.'Lady Georgina's nephew,' I answered, with a tell-tale cheek, I fear.'You remember I mentioned to you that I had met him at Schlangenbad. Butthis is really too bad of that wicked old Lady Georgina. She has toldhim where we lived and sent him up to see us.''Perhaps,' Elsie put in, 'he wants to charter a bicycle.'I glanced at Elsie sideways. I had an uncomfortable suspicion that shesaid it slyly, like one who knew he wanted nothing of the sort. But atany rate, I brushed the suggestion aside frankly. 'Nonsense,' Ianswered. 'He wants _me_, not a bicycle.'He came up to us, waving his hat. He _did_ look handsome! 'Well, MissCayley,' he cried from afar, 'I have tracked you to your lair! I havefound out where you abide! What a beautiful spot! And how well you'relooking!''This is an unexpected----' I paused. He thought I was going to say,'pleasure,' but I finished it, 'intrusion.' His face fell. 'How did youknow we were at Lungern, Mr. Tillington?''My respected relative,' he answered, laughing. 'Shementioned--casually--' his eyes met mine--'that you were stopping in a_chalet_. And as I was on my way back to the diplomatic mill, I thoughtI might just as well walk over the Grimsel and the Furca, and then on tothe Gotthard. The Court is at Monza. So it occurred to me ... that inpassing ... I might venture to drop in and say how-do-you-do to you.''Thank you,' I answered, severely--but my heart spoke otherwise--'I dovery well. And you, Mr. Tillington?''Badly,' he echoed. 'Badly, since _you_ went away from Schlangenbad.'I gazed at his dusty feet. 'You are tramping,' I said, cruelly. 'Isuppose you will get forward for lunch to Meiringen?''I-- I did not contemplate it.''Indeed?'He grew bolder. 'No; to say the truth, I half hoped I might stop andspend the day here with you.''Elsie,' I remarked firmly, 'if Mr. Tillington persists in plantinghimself upon us like this, one of us must go and investigate the kitchendepartment.'Elsie rose like a lamb. I have an impression that she gathered we wantedto be left alone.[Illustration: I MAY STAY, MAYN'T I?]He turned to me imploringly. 'Lois,' he cried, stretching out his arms,with an appealing air, 'I _may_ stay, mayn't I?'I tried to be stern; but I fear 'twas a feeble pretence. 'We are twogirls, alone in a house,' I answered. 'Lady Georgina, as a matron ofexperience, ought to have protected us. Merely to give you lunch isalmost irregular. (Good diplomatic word, irregular.) Still, in thesedays, I suppose you _may_ stay, if you leave early in the afternoon.That's the utmost I can do for you.''You are not gracious,' he cried, gazing at me with a wistful look.I did not dare to be gracious. 'Uninvited guests must not quarrel withtheir welcome,' I answered severely. Then the woman in me broke forth.'But indeed, Mr. Tillington, I am glad to see you.'He leaned forward eagerly. 'So you are not angry with me, Lois? I maycall you _Lois_?'I trembled and hesitated. 'I am not angry with you. I-- I like you toomuch to be ever angry with you. And I am glad you came--just thisonce--to see me.... Yes,--when we are alone--you may call me Lois.'He tried to seize my hand. I withdrew it. 'Then I may perhaps hope,' hebegan, 'that some day----'I shook my head. 'No, no,' I said, regretfully. 'You misunderstand me.I like you very much; and I like to see you. But as long as you are richand have prospects like yours, I could never marry you. My pridewouldn't let me. Take that as final.'I looked away. He bent forward again. 'But if I were poor?' he put in,eagerly.I hesitated. Then my heart rose, and I gave way. 'If ever you are poor,'I faltered,--'penniless, hunted, friendless--come to me, Harold, and Iwill help and comfort you. But not till then. Not till then, I imploreyou.'He leant back and clasped his hands. 'You have given me something tolive for, dear Lois,' he murmured. 'I will try to be poor--penniless,hunted, friendless. To win you I will try. And when that day arrives, Ishall come to claim you.'We sat for an hour and had a delicious talk--about nothing. But weunderstood each other. Only that artificial barrier divided us. At theend of the hour, I heard Elsie coming back by judiciously slow stagesfrom the kitchen to the living-room, through six feet of passage,discoursing audibly to Ursula all the way, with a tardiness that didhonour to her heart and her understanding. Dear, kind little Elsie! Ibelieve she had never a tiny romance of her own; yet her sympathy forothers was sweet to look upon.We lunched at a small deal table in the veranda. Around us rose thepinnacles. The scent of pines and moist moss was in the air. Elsie hadarranged the flowers, and got ready the omelette, and cooked the chickencutlets, and prepared the junket. 'I never thought I could do it alonewithout you, Brownie; but I tried, and it all came right by magic,somehow.' We laughed and talked incessantly. Harold was in excellentcue; and Elsie took to him. A livelier or merrier table there wasn't inthe twenty-two Cantons that day than ours, under the sapphire sky,looking out on the sun-smitten snows of the Jungfrau.After lunch, Harold begged hard to be allowed to stop for tea. I hadmisgivings, but I gave way--he _was_ such good company. One may as wellbe hanged for a sheep as a lamb, says the wisdom of our ancestors: and,after all, Mrs. Grundy was only represented here by Elsie, the gentlestand least censorious of her daughters. So he stopped and chatted tillfour; when I made tea and insisted on dismissing him. He meant to takethe rough mountain path over the screes from Lungern to Meiringen, whichran right behind the _chalet_. I feared lest he might be belated, andurged him to hurry.'Thanks, I'm happier here,' he answered.I was sternness itself. 'You _promised_ me!' I said, in a reproachfulvoice.He rose instantly, and bowed. 'Your will is law--even when it pronouncessentence of exile.'Would we walk a little way with him? No, I faltered; we would not. Wewould follow him with the opera-glasses and wave him farewell when hereached the Kulm. He shook our hands unwillingly, and turned up thelittle path, looking handsomer than ever. It led ascending through afir-wood to the rock-strewn hillside.Once, a quarter of an hour later, we caught a glimpse of him near asharp turn in the road; after that we waited in vain, with our eyesfixed on the Kulm; not a sign could we discern of him. At last I grewanxious. 'He ought to be there,' I cried, fuming.'He ought,' Elsie answered.I swept the slopes with the opera-glasses. Anxiety and interest in himquickened my senses, I suppose. 'Look here, Elsie,' I burst out at last.'Just take this glass and have a glance at those birds, down the cragbelow the Kulm. Don't they seem to be circling and behaving most oddly?'Elsie gazed where I bid her. 'They're wheeling round and round,' sheanswered, after a minute; 'and they certainly _do_ look as if they werescreaming.''They seem to be frightened,' I suggested.'It looks like it, Brownie,''Then he's fallen over a precipice!' I cried, rising up; 'and he's lyingthere on a ledge by their nest. Elsie, we must go to him!'She clasped her hands and looked terrified. 'Oh, Brownie, how dreadful!'she exclaimed. Her face was deadly white. Mine burned like fire.'Not a moment to lose!' I said, holding my breath. 'Get out the rope andlet us run to him!''Don't you think,' Elsie suggested, 'we had better hurry down on ourcycles to Lungern and call some men from the village to help us? We aretwo girls, and alone. What can we do to aid him?''No,' I answered, promptly, 'that won't do. It would only lose time--andtime may be precious. You and I must go; I'll send Ursula off to bringup guides from the village.'Fortunately, we had a good long coil of new rope in the house, whichMrs. Evelegh had provided in case of accident. I slipped it on my arm,and set out on foot; for the path was by far too rough for cycles. I wassorry afterwards that I had not taken Ursula, and sent Elsie to Lungernto rouse the men; for she found the climbing hard, and I had difficultyat times in dragging her up the steep and stony pathway, almost awatercourse. However, we persisted in the direction of the Kulm,tracking Harold by his footprints; for he wore mountain boots withsharp-headed nails, which made dints in the moist soil, and scratchedthe smooth surface of the rock where he trod on it.We followed him thus for a mile or two, along the regular path; then ofa sudden, in an open part, the trail failed us. I turned back, a fewyards, and looked close, with my eyes fixed on the spongy soil, as keenas a hound that sniffs his way after his quarry. 'He went off _here_,Elsie!' I said at last, pulling up short by a spindle bush on thehillside.'How do you know, Brownie?''Why, see, there are the marks of his stick; he had a thick one, youremember, with a square iron spike. These are its dints; I have beenwatching them all the way along from the _chalet_!'But there are so many such marks!''Yes, I know; I can tell his from the older ones made by the spikes ofalpenstocks because Harold's are fresher and sharper on the edge. Theylook so much newer. See, here, he slipped on the rock; you can know thatscratch is recent by the clean way it's traced, and the littleglistening crystals still left behind in it. Those other marks have beenwind-swept and washed by the rain. There are no broken particles.''How on earth did you find that out, Brownie?'How on earth did I find it out! I wondered myself. But the emergencyseemed somehow to teach me something of the instinctive lore of huntersand savages. I did not trouble to answer her. 'At this bush, the tracksfail,' I went on; 'and, look, he must have clutched at that branch andcrushed the broken leaves as the twigs slipped through his fingers. Heleft the path here, then, and struck off on a short cut of his own alongthe hillside, lower down. Elsie, we must follow him.'She shrank from it; but I held her hand. It was a more difficult taskto track him now; for we had no longer the path to guide us. However, Iexplored the ground on my hands and knees, and soon found marks offootsteps on the boggy patches, with scratches on the rock where he hadleapt from point to point, or planted his stick to steady himself. Itried to help Elsie along among the littered boulders and the dwarfgrowth of wind-swept daphne: but, poor child, it was too much for her:she sat down after a few minutes upon the flat juniper scrub and beganto cry. What was I to do? My anxiety was breathless. I couldn't leaveher there alone, and I couldn't forsake Harold. Yet I felt every minutemight now be critical. We were making among wet whortleberry thicket andtorn rock towards the spot where I had seen the birds wheel and circle,screaming. The only way left was to encourage Elsie and make her feelthe necessity for instant action. 'He is alive still,' I exclaimed,looking up; 'the birds are crying! If he were dead, they would return totheir nest-- Elsie, we _must_ get to him!'She rose, bewildered, and followed me. I held her hand tight, and coaxedher to scramble over the rocks where the scratches showed the way, or toclamber at times over fallen trunks of huge fir-trees. Yet it was hardwork climbing; even Harold's sure feet had slipped often on the wet andslimy boulders, though, like most of Queen Margherita's set, he was anexpert mountaineer. Then, at times, I lost the faint track, so that Ihad to diverge and look close to find it. These delays fretted me. 'See,a stone loosed from its bed--he must have passed by here.... That twigis newly snapped; no doubt he caught at it.... Ha, the moss there hasbeen crushed; a foot has gone by. And the ants on that ant-hill, withtheir eggs in their mouths--a man's tread has frightened them.' So, bysome instinctive sense, as if the spirit of my savage ancestors revivedwithin me, I managed to recover the spoor again and again by a miracle,till at last, round a corner by a defiant cliff--with a terribleforeboding, my heart stood still within me.We had come to an end. A great projecting buttress of crag rose sheer infront. Above lay loose boulders. Below was a shrub-hung precipice. Thebirds we had seen from home were still circling and screaming.They were a pair of peregrine hawks. Their nest seemed to lie far belowthe broken scar, some sixty or seventy feet beneath us.'He is not dead!' I cried once more, with my heart in my mouth. 'If hewere, they would have returned. He has fallen, and is lying, alive,below there!'[Illustration: I ADVANCED ON MY HANDS AND KNEES TO THE EDGE OF THEPRECIPICE.]Elsie shrank back against the wall of rock. I advanced on my hands andknees to the edge of the precipice. It was not quite sheer, but itdropped like a sea-cliff, with broken ledges.I could see where Harold had slipped. He had tried to climb round thecrag that blocked the road, and the ground at the edge of the precipicehad given way with him; it showed a recent founder of a few inches. Thenhe clutched at a branch of broom as he fell; but it slipped through hisfingers, cutting them; for there was blood on the wiry stem. I knelt bythe side of the cliff and craned my head over. I scarcely dared to look.In spite of the birds, my heart misgave me.There, on a ledge deep below, he lay in a mass, half raised on one arm.But not dead, I believed. 'Harold!' I cried. 'Harold!'He turned his face up and saw me; his eyes lighted with joy. He shoutedback something, but I could not hear it.I turned to Elsie. 'I must go down to him!'Her tears rose again. 'Oh, Brownie!'I unwound the coil of rope. The first thing was to fasten it. I couldnot trust Elsie to hold it; she was too weak and too frightened to bearmy weight: even if I wound it round her body, I feared my mere massmight drag her over. I peered about at the surroundings. No tree grewnear; no rock had a pinnacle sufficiently safe to depend upon. But Ifound a plan soon. In the crag behind me was a cleft, narrowingwedge-shape as it descended. I tied the end of the rope round a stone,a good big water-worn stone, rudely girdled with a groove near themiddle, which prevented it from slipping; then I dropped it down thefissure till it jammed; after which, I tried it to see if it would bear.It was firm as the rock itself. I let the rope down by it, and waited amoment to discover whether Harold could climb. He shook his head, andtook a notebook with evident pain from his pocket. Then he scribbled afew words, and pinned them to the rope. I hauled it up. 'Can't move.Either severely bruised and sprained, or else legs broken.'There was no help for it, then. I must go to him.My first idea was merely to glide down the rope with my gloved hands,for I chanced to have my dog-skin bicycling gloves in my pocket.Fortunately, however, I did not carry out this crude idea too hastily;for next instant it occurred to me that I could not swarm up again. Ihave had no practice in rope-climbing. Here was a problem. But themoment suggested its own solution. I began making knots, or rathernooses or loops, in the rope, at intervals of about eighteen inches.'What are they for?' Elsie asked, looking on in wonder.'Footholds, to climb up by.''But the ones above will pull out with your weight.''I don't think so. Still, to make sure, I shall tie them with thisstring. I _must_ get down to him.'I threaded a sufficient number of loops, trying the length over theedge. Then I said to Elsie, who sat cowering, propped against the crag,'You must come and look over, and do as I wave to you. Mind, dear, you_must_! Two lives depend upon it.''Brownie, I daren't? I shall turn giddy and fall over!'I smoothed her golden hair. 'Elsie, dear,' I said gently, gazing intoher blue eyes, 'you are a woman. A woman can always be brave, wherethose she loves are concerned; and I believe you love me.' I led her,coaxingly, to the edge. 'Sit there,' I said, in my quietest voice, so asnot to alarm her. 'You can lie at full length, if you like, and onlyjust peep over. But when I wave my hand, remember, you must pull therope up.'She obeyed me like a child. I knew she loved me.[Illustration: I GRIPPED THE ROPE AND LET MYSELF DOWN.]I gripped the rope and let myself down, not using the loops to descend,but just sliding with hands and knees, and allowing the knots to slackenmy pace. Half-way down, I will confess, the eerie feeling of physicalsuspense was horrible. One hung so in mid-air! The hawks flapped theirwings. But Harold was below; and a woman can always be brave where thoseshe loves--well, just that moment, catching my breath, I knew I lovedHarold.I glided down swiftly. The air whizzed. At last, on a narrow shelf ofrock, I leant over him. He seized my hand. 'I knew you would come!' hecried. 'I felt sure you would find out. Though, _how_ you found out,Heaven only knows, you clever, brave little woman!''Are you terribly hurt?' I asked, bending close. His clothes were torn.'I hardly know. I can't move. It may only be bruises.''Can you climb by these nooses with my help?'He shook his head. 'Oh, no. I couldn't climb at all. I must be lifted,somehow. You had better go back to Lungern and bring men to help you.''And leave you here alone! Never, Harold; never!''Then what can we do?'I reflected a moment. 'Lend me your pencil,' I said. He pulled itout--his arms were almost unhurt, fortunately. I scribbled a line toElsie. 'Tie my plaid to the rope and let it down.' Then I waved to herto pull up again.I was half surprised to find she obeyed the signal, for she crouchedthere, white-faced and open-mouthed, watching; but I have often observedthat women are almost always brave in the great emergencies. She pinnedon the plaid and let it down with commendable quickness. I doubled it,and tied firm knots in the four corners, so as to make it into a sort ofbasket; then I fastened it at each corner with a piece of the rope,crossed in the middle, till it looked like one of the cages they use inmills for letting down sacks with. As soon as it was finished, I said,'Now, just try to crawl into it.'He raised himself on his arms and crawled in with difficulty. His legsdragged after him. I could see he was in great pain. But still, hemanaged it.I planted my foot in the first noose. 'You must sit still,' I said,breathless. 'I am going back to haul you up.''Are you strong enough, Lois?''With Elsie to help me, yes. I often stroked a four at Girton.''I can trust you,' he answered. It thrilled me that he said so.I began my hazardous journey; I mounted the rope by the nooses--one,two, three, four, counting them as I mounted. I did not dare to look upor down as I did so, lest I should grow giddy and fall, but kept my eyesfixed firmly always on the one noose in front of me. My brain swam: therope swayed and creaked. Twenty, thirty, forty! Foot after foot, Islipped them in mechanically, taking up with me the longer coil whoseends were attached to the cage and Harold. My hands trembled; it wasghastly, swinging there between earth and heaven. Forty-five, forty-six,forty-seven-- I knew there were forty-eight of them. At last, after someweeks, as it seemed, I reached the summit. Tremulous and half dead, Iprised myself over the edge with my hands, and knelt once more on thehill beside Elsie.She was white, but attentive. 'What next, Brownie?' Her voice quivered.I looked about me. I was too faint and shaky after my perilous ascent tobe fit for work, but there was no help for it. What could I use as apulley? Not a tree grew near; but the stone jammed in the fissure mightonce more serve my purpose. I tried it again. It had borne my weight;was it strong enough to bear the precious weight of Harold? I tugged atit, and thought so. I passed the rope round it like a pulley, and thentied it about my own waist. I had a happy thought: I could use myself asa windlass. I turned on my feet for a pivot. Elsie helped me to pull.'Up you go!' I cried, cheerily. We wound slowly, for fear of shakinghim. Bit by bit, I could feel the cage rise gradually from the ground;its weight, taken so, with living capstan and stone axle, was less thanI should have expected. But the pulley helped us, and Elsie, spurred byneed, put forth more reserve of nervous strength than I could easilyhave believed lay in that tiny body. I twisted myself round and round,close to the edge, so as to look over from time to time, but not at allquickly, for fear of dizziness. The rope strained and gave. It was adeadly ten minutes of suspense and anxiety. Twice or thrice as I lookeddown I saw a spasm of pain break over Harold's face; but when I pausedand glanced inquiringly, he motioned me to go on with my venturesometask. There was no turning back now. We had almost got him up when therope at the edge began to creak ominously.It was straining at the point where it grated against the brink of theprecipice. My heart gave a leap. If the rope broke, all was over.With a sudden dart forward, I seized it with my hands, below the partthat gave; then--one fierce little run back--and I brought him levelwith the edge. He clutched at Elsie's hand. I turned thrice round, towind the slack about my body. The taut rope cut deep into my flesh; butnothing mattered now, except to save him. 'Catch the cloak, Elsie!' Icried; 'catch it: pull him gently in!' Elsie caught it and pulled himin, with wonderful pluck and calmness. We hauled him over the edge. Helay safe on the bank. Then we all three broke down and cried likechildren together. I took his hand in mine and held it in silence.When we found words again I drew a deep breath, and said, simply, 'Howdid you manage to do it?'[Illustration: I ROLLED AND SLID DOWN.]'I tried to clamber past the wall that barred the way there by sheerforce of stride--you know, my legs are long--and I somehow overbalancedmyself. But I didn't exactly fall--if I had fallen, I must have beenkilled; I rolled and slid down, clutching at the weeds in the cranniesas I slipped, and stumbling over the projections, without quite losingmy foothold on the ledges, till I found myself brought up short with abump at the end of it.''And you think no bones are broken?''I can't feel sure. It hurts me horribly to move. I fancy just at firstI must have fainted. But I'm inclined to guess I'm only sprained andbruised and sore all over. Why, you're as bad as me, I believe. See,your dear hands are all torn and bleeding!''How are we ever to get him back again, Brownie?' Elsie put in. She waspaler than ever now, and prostrate with the after-effects of herunwonted effort.'You are a practical woman, Elsie,' I answered. 'Stop with him here aminute or two. I'll climb up the hillside and halloo for Ursula and themen from Lungern.'I climbed and hallooed. In a few minutes, worn out as I was, I hadreached the path above and attracted their attention. They hurried downto where Harold lay, and, using my cage for a litter, slung on a youngfir-trunk, carried him back between them across their shoulders to thevillage. He pleaded hard to be allowed to remain at the _chalet_, andElsie joined her prayers to his; but, there, I was adamant. It was notso much what people might say that I minded, but a deeper difficulty.For if once I nursed him through this trouble, how could I or any womanin my place any longer refuse him? So I passed him ruthlessly on toLungern (though my heart ached for it), and telegraphed at once to hisnearest relative, Lady Georgina, to come up and take care of him.He recovered rapidly. Though sore and shaken, his worst hurts, it turnedout, were sprains; and in three or four days he was ready to go onagain. I called to see him before he left. I dreaded the interview; forone's own heart is a hard enemy to fight so long: but how could I lethim go without one word of farewell to him?'After this, Lois,' he said, taking my hand in his--and I was weakenough, for a moment, to let it lie there--'you _cannot_ say No to me!'Oh, how I longed to fling myself upon him and cry out, 'No, Harold, Icannot! I love you too dearly!' But his future and Marmaduke Ashurst'shalf million restrained me: for his sake and for my own I held myself incourageously. Though, indeed, it needed some courage and self-control. Iwithdrew my hand slowly. 'Do you remember,' I said, 'you asked me thatfirst day at Schlangenbad'--it was an epoch to me now, that firstday--'whether I was medi\\u00e6val or modern? And I answered, \\\"Modern, Ihope.\\\" And you said, \\\"That's well!\\\"-- You see, I don't forget the leastthings you say to me. Well, because I am modern--'my lips trembled andbelied me--'I can answer you No. I can even now refuse you. Theold-fashioned girl, the medi\\u00e6val girl, would have held that because shesaved your life (if I _did_ save your life, which is a matter ofopinion) she was bound to marry you. But _I_ am modern, and I see thingsdifferently. If there were reasons at Schlangenbad which made itimpracticable for me to accept you--though my heart pleaded hard--I donot deny it--those reasons cannot have disappeared merely because youhave chosen to fall over a precipice, and I have pulled you up again. Mydecision was founded, you see, not on passing accidents of situation,but on permanent considerations. Nothing has happened in the last threedays to affect those considerations. We are still ourselves: you, rich;I, a penniless adventuress. I could not accept you when you asked me atSchlangenbad. On just the same grounds, I cannot accept you now. I donot see how the unessential fact that I made myself into a winch to pullyou up the cliff, and that I am still smarting for it----'He looked me all over comically. 'How severe we are!' he cried, in abantering tone. 'And how extremely Girtony! A System of Logic,Ratiocinative and Inductive, by Lois Cayley! What a pity we didn't takea professor's chair. My child that isn't _you_! It's not yourself atall! It's an attempt to be unnaturally and unfemininely reasonable.'Logic fled. I broke down utterly. 'Harold,' I cried, rising, 'I loveyou! I admit I love you! But I will never marry you--while you havethose thousands.''I haven't got them yet!''Or the chance of inheriting them.'He smothered my hand with kisses--for I withdrew my face. 'If you admityou love me,' he cried, quite joyously, 'then all is well. When once awoman admits that, the rest is but a matter of time--and, Lois, I canwait a thousand years for you.''Not in my case,' I answered through my tears. 'Not in my case, Harold!I am a modern woman, and what I say I mean. I will renew my promise. Ifever you are poor and friendless, come to me; I am yours. Till then,don't harrow me by asking me the impossible!'I tore myself away. At the hall door, Lady Georgina intercepted me. Sheglanced at my red eyes. 'Then you have taken him?' she cried, seizing myhand.I shook my head firmly. I could hardly speak. 'No, Lady Georgina,' Ianswered, in a choking voice. 'I have refused him again. I will notstand in his way. I will not ruin his prospects.'She drew back and let her chin drop. 'Well, of all the hard-hearted,cruel, obdurate young women I ever saw in my born days, if you're notthe very hardest----'[Illustration]I half ran from the house. I hurried home to the _chalet_. There, Idashed into my own room, locked the door behind me, flung myself wildlyon my bed, and, burying my face in my hands, had a good, long,hard-hearted, cruel, obdurate cry--exactly like any other medi\\u00e6valwoman. It's all very well being modern; but my experience is that, whenit comes to a man one loves--well, the Middle Ages are still horriblystrong within us.VITHE ADVENTURE OF THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMANWhen Elsie's holidays--I beg pardon, vacation--came to an end, sheproposed to return to her High School in London. Zeal for the highermathematics devoured her. But she still looked so frail, and coughed sooften--a perfect _Campo Santo_ of a cough--in spite of her summer ofopen-air exercise, that I positively worried her into consulting adoctor--not one of the Fortescue-Langley order. The report he gave wasmildly unfavourable. He spoke disrespectfully of the apex of her rightlung. It was not exactly tubercular, he remarked, but he 'fearedtuberculosis'--excuse the long words; the phrase was his, not mine; Irepeat _verbatim_. He vetoed her exposing herself to a winter in Londonin her present unstable condition. Davos? Well, no. _Not_ Davos: withdeliberative thumb and finger on close-shaven chin. He judged her toodelicate for such drastic remedies. Those high mountain stations suitedbest the robust invalid, who had dropped by accident into casualphthisis. For Miss Petheridge's case--looking wise--he would notrecommend the Riviera, either: too stimulating, too exciting. What thisyoung lady needed most was rest: rest in some agreeable southern town,some city of the soul--say Rome or Florence--where she might find muchto interest her, and might forget the apex of her right lung in the newworld of art that opened around her.'Very well,' I said, promptly; 'that's settled, Elsie. The apex and youshall winter in Florence.''But, Brownie, can we afford it?''Afford it?' I echoed. 'Goodness gracious, my dear child, what abourgeois sentiment! Your medical attendant says to you, \\\"Go toFlorence\\\": and to Florence you must go; there's no getting out of it.Why, even the swallows fly south when their medical attendant tells themEngland is turning a trifle too cold for them.''But what will Miss Latimer say? She depends upon me to come back at thebeginning of term. She _must_ have _somebody_ to undertake the highermathematics.''And she will get somebody, dear,' I answered, calmly. 'Don't troubleyour sweet little head about that. An eminent statistician hascalculated that five hundred and thirty duly qualified young women arenow standing four-square in a solid phalanx in the streets of London,all agog to teach the higher mathematics to anyone who wants them at amoment's notice. Let Miss Latimer take her pick of the five hundred andthirty. I'll wire to her at once: \\\"Elsie Petheridge unable through illhealth to resume her duties. Ordered to Florence. Resigns post. Engagesubstitute.\\\" _That's_ the way to do it.'Elsie clasped her small white hands in the despair of the woman whoconsiders herself indispensable--as if we were any of us indispensable!'But, dearest, the girls! They'll be _so_ disappointed!''They'll get over it,' I answered, grimly. 'There are worsedisappointments in store for them in life-- Which is a fine old crustedplatitude worthy of Aunt Susan. Anyhow, I've decided. Look here, Elsie:I stand to you _in loco parentis_.' I have already remarked, I think,that she was three years my senior; but I was so pleased with thisphrase that I repeated it lovingly. 'I stand to you, dear, _in locoparentis_. Now, I can't let you endanger your precious health byreturning to town and Miss Latimer this winter. Let us be categorical. Igo to Florence; you go with me.''What shall we live upon?' Elsie suggested, piteously.'Our fellow-creatures, as usual,' I answered, with prompt callousness.'I object to these base utilitarian considerations being imported intothe discussion of a serious question. Florence is the city of art; as awoman of culture, it behoves you to revel in it. Your medical attendantsends you there; as a patient and an invalid, you can revel with a clearconscience. Money? Well, money is a secondary matter. All philosophiesand all religions agree that money is mere dross, filthy lucre. Risesuperior to it. We have a fair sum in hand to the credit of the firm; wecan pick up some more, I suppose, in Florence.''How?'I reflected. 'Elsie,' I said, 'you are deficient in Faith--which is oneof the leading Christian graces. My mission in life is to correct thatwant in your spiritual nature. Now, observe how beautifully all theseevents work in together! The winter comes, when no man can bicycle,especially in Switzerland. Therefore, what is the use of my stopping onhere after October? Again, in pursuance of my general plan of goinground the world, I must get forward to Italy. Your medical attendantconsiderately orders you at the same time to Florence. In Florence weshall still have chances of selling Manitous, though possibly, I admit,in diminished numbers. I confess at once that people come to Switzerlandto tour, and are therefore liable to need our machines; while they go toFlorence to look at pictures, and a bicycle would doubtless proveinconvenient in the Uffizi or the Pitti. Still, we _may_ sell a few. ButI descry another opening. You write shorthand, don't you?''A little, dear; only ninety words a minute.''_That's_ not business. Advertise yourself, _\\u00e0 la_ Cyrus Hitchcock! Sayboldly, \\\"I write shorthand.\\\" Leave the world to ask, \\\"How fast?\\\" It willask it quick enough without your suggesting it. Well, my idea is this.Florence is a town teeming with English tourists of the cultivatedclasses--men of letters, painters, antiquaries, art-critics. I supposeeven art-critics may be classed as cultivated. Such people are sure toneed literary aid. We exist, to supply it. We will set up the FlorentineSchool of Stenography and Typewriting. We'll buy a couple oftypewriters.''How can we pay for them, Brownie?'[Illustration: THERE'S ENTERPRISE FOR YOU!]I gazed at her in despair. 'Elsie,' I cried, clapping my hand to myhead, 'you are not practical. Did I ever suggest we should pay for them?I said merely, buy them. Base is the slave that pays. That'sShakespeare. And we all know Shakespeare is the mirror of nature. Argal,it would be unnatural to pay for a typewriter. We will hire a room inFlorence (on tick, of course), and begin operations. Clients will flockin; and we tide over the winter. _There's_ enterprise for you!' And Istruck an attitude.Elsie's face looked her doubts. I walked across to Mrs. Evelegh's desk,and began writing a letter. It occurred to me that Mr. Hitchcock, whowas a man of business, might be able to help a woman of business in thisdelicate matter. I put the point to him fairly and squarely, withoutcircumlocution; we were going to start an English typewriting office inFlorence; what was the ordinary way for people to become possessed of atypewriting machine, without the odious and mercenary preliminary ofpaying for it? The answer came back with commendable promptitude.     DEAR MISS,--Your spirit of enterprise is really remarkable! I have     forwarded your letter to my friends of the Spread Eagle     Typewriting and Phonograph Company, Limited, of New York City,     informing them of your desire to open an agency for the sale of     their machines in Florence, Italy, and giving them my estimate of     your business capacities. I have advised their London house to     present you with two complimentary machines for your own use and     your partner's, and also to supply a number of others for disposal     in the city of Florence. If you would further like to undertake an     agency for the development of the trade in salt codfish (large     quantities of which are, of course, consumed in Catholic Europe),     I could put you into communication with my respected friends,     Messrs. Abel Woodward and Co., exporters of preserved provisions,     St John, Newfoundland. But, perhaps in this suggestion I am not     sufficiently high-toned.--Respectfully, CYRUS W. HITCHCOCK.The moment had arrived for Elsie to be firm. 'I have no prejudiceagainst trade, Brownie,' she observed emphatically; 'but I do draw theline at salt fish.''So do I, dear,' I answered.She sighed her relief. I really believe she half expected to find metrotting about Florence with miscellaneous samples of Messrs. AbelWoodward's esteemed productions protruding from my pocket.So to Florence we went. My first idea was to travel by the Brenner routethrough the Tyrol; but a queer little episode which met us at the outseton the Austrian frontier put a check to this plan. We cycled to theborder, sending our trunks on by rail. When we went to claim them at theAustrian Custom-house, we were told they were detained 'for politicalreasons.''Political reasons?' I exclaimed, nonplussed.'Even so, Fr\\u00e4ulein. Your boxes contain revolutionary literature.''Some mistake!' I cried, warmly. I am but a drawing-room Socialist.'Not at all; look here.' And he drew a small book out of Elsie'sportmanteau.What? Elsie a conspirator? Elsie in league with Nihilists? So mild andso meek! I could never have believed it. I took the book in my hands andread the title, 'Revolution of the Heavenly Bodies.''But this is astronomy,' I burst out. 'Don't you see? Sun-and-starcircling. The revolution of the planets.''It matters not, Fr\\u00e4ulein. Our instructions are strict. We have ordersto intercept _all_ revolutionary literature without distinction.''Come, Elsie,' I said, firmly, 'this is _too_ ridiculous. Let us givethem a clear berth, these Kaiserly-Kingly blockheads!' So we registeredour luggage right back to Lucerne, and cycled over the Gotthard.[Illustration: PAINTING THE SIGN-BOARD.]When at last, by leisurely stages, we arrived at Florence, I felt therewas no use in doing things by halves. If you are going to start theFlorentine School of Stenography and Typewriting, you may as well startit on a proper basis. So I took sunny rooms at a nice hotel for myselfand Elsie, and hired a ground floor in a convenient house, close underthe shadow of the great marble Campanile. (Considerations of spacecompel me to curtail the usual gush about Arnolfo and Giotto.) This wasour office. When I had got a Tuscan painter to plant our flag in theshape of a sign-board, I sailed forth into the street and inspected itfrom outside with a swelling heart. It is true, the Tuscan painter'sunaccountable predilection for the rare spellings 'Scool' without an _h_and 'Stenografy' with an _f_, somewhat damped my exuberant pride for themoment; but I made him take the board back and correct his ItalianateEnglish. As soon as all was fitted up with desk and tables we reposedupon our laurels, and waited only for customers in shoals to pour inupon us. _I_ called them 'customers'; Elsie maintained that we oughtrather to say 'clients.' Being by temperament averse to sectarianism, Idid not dispute the point with her.We reposed on our laurels--in vain. Neither customers nor clients seemedin any particular hurry to disturb our leisure.I confess I took this ill. It was a rude awakening. I had begun toregard myself as the special favourite of a fairy godmother; itsurprised me to find that any undertaking of mine did not succeedimmediately. However, reflecting that my fairy godmother's name wasreally Enterprise, I recalled Mr. Cyrus W. Hitchcock's advice, andadvertised.'There's one good thing about Florence, Elsie,' I said, just to keep upher courage. 'When the customers _do_ come, they'll be interestingpeople, and it will be interesting work. Artistic work, don't youknow--Fra Angelico, and Della Robbia, and all that sort of thing; orelse fresh light on Dante and Petrarch!''When they _do_ come, no doubt,' Elsie answered, dubiously. 'But do youknow, Brownie, it strikes me there isn't quite that literary stir andferment one might expect in Florence. Dante and Petrarch appear to bedead. The distinguished authors fail to stream in upon us as oneimagined with manuscripts to copy.'I affected an air of confidence--for I had sunk capital in the concern(that's business-like--sunk capital!). 'Oh, we're a new firm,' Iassented, carelessly. 'Our enterprise is yet young. When cultivatedFlorence learns we're here, cultivated Florence will invade us in itsthousands.'But we sat in our office and bit our thumbs all day; the thousandsstopped at home. We had ample opportunities for making studies of thedecorative detail on the Campanile, till we knew every square inch of itbetter than Mr. Ruskin. Elsie's notebook contains, I believe, elevenhundred separate sketches of the Campanile, from the right end, the leftend, and the middle of our window, with eight hundred and five distinctdistortions of the individual statues that adorn its niches on the sideturned towards us.At last, after we had sat, and bitten our thumbs, and sketched the FourGreater Prophets for a fortnight on end, an immense excitement occurred.An old gentleman was distinctly seen to approach and to look up at thesign-board which decorated our office.I instantly slipped in a sheet of foolscap, and began to type-write withalarming speed--click, click, click; while Elsie, rising to theoccasion, set to work to transcribe imaginary shorthand as if her lifedepended upon it.The old gentleman, after a moment's hesitation, lifted the latch of thedoor somewhat nervously. I affected to take no notice of him, sobreathless was the haste with which our immense business connectioncompelled me to finger the keyboard: but, looking up at him under myeyelashes, I could just make out he was a peculiarly bland and urbaneold person, dressed with the greatest care, and some attention tofashion. His face was smooth; it tended towards portliness.He made up his mind, and entered the office. I continued to click till Ihad reached the close of a sentence--'Or to take arms against a sea oftroubles, and by opposing, end them.' Then I looked up sharply. 'Can Ido anything for you?' I inquired, in the smartest tone of business. (Iobserve that politeness is not professional.)[Illustration: THE URBANE OLD GENTLEMAN.]The Urbane Old Gentleman came forward with his hat in his hand. Helooked as if he had just landed from the Eighteenth Century. His figurewas that of Mr. Edward Gibbon. 'Yes, madam,' he said, in a markedlydeferential tone, fussing about with the rim of his hat as he spoke, andadjusting his _pince-nez_. 'I was recommended to your--ur--yourestablishment for shorthand and typewriting. I have some work which Iwish done, if it falls within your province. But I am _rather_particular. I require a quick worker. Excuse my asking it, but how manywords can you do a minute?''Shorthand?' I asked, sharply, for I wished to imitate official habits.The Urbane Old Gentleman bowed. 'Yes, shorthand. Certainly.'I waved my hand with careless grace towards Elsie--as if these thingshappened to us daily. 'Miss Petheridge undertakes the shorthanddepartment,' I said, with decision. 'I am the typewriting fromdictation. Miss Petheridge, forward!'Elsie rose to it like an angel. 'A hundred,' she answered, confrontinghim.The old gentleman bowed again. 'And your terms?' he inquired, in ahoney-tongued voice. 'If I may venture to ask them.'We handed him our printed tariff. He seemed satisfied.'Could you spare me an hour this morning?' he asked, still fingering hishat nervously with his puffy hand. 'But perhaps you are engaged. I fearI intrude upon you.''Not at all,' I answered, consulting an imaginary engagement list. 'Thiswork can wait. Let me see: 11.30. Elsie, I think you have nothing to dobefore one, that cannot be put off? Quite so!--very well, then; yes, weare both at your service.'The Urbane Old Gentleman looked about him for a seat. I pushed him ourone easy chair. He withdrew his gloves with great deliberation, and satdown in it with an apologetic glance. I could gather from his dress andhis diamond pin that he was wealthy. Indeed, I half guessed who he wasalready. There was a fussiness about his manner which seemed strangelyfamiliar to me.He sat down by slow degrees, edging himself about till he was thoroughlycomfortable. I could see he was of the kind that will have comfort. Hetook out his notes and a packet of letters, which he sorted slowly. Thenhe looked hard at me and at Elsie. He seemed to be making his choicebetween us. After a time he spoke. 'I _think_,' he said, in a mostleisurely voice, 'I will not trouble your friend to write shorthand forme, after all. Or should I say your assistant? Excuse my change of plan.I will content myself with dictation. You can follow on the machine?''As fast as you choose to dictate to me.'He glanced at his notes and began a letter. It was a curiouscommunication. It seemed to be all about buying Bertha and sellingClara--a cold-blooded proceeding which almost suggested slave-dealing. Igathered he was giving instructions to his agent: could he have businessrelations with Cuba, I wondered. But there were also hints of mysteriousmiddies--brave British tars to the rescue, possibly! Perhaps mybewilderment showed itself upon my face, for at last he looked queerlyat me. 'You don't quite like this, I'm afraid,' he said, breaking offshort.I was the soul of business. 'Not at all,' I answered. 'I am anautomaton--nothing more. It is a typewriter's function to transcribe thewords a client dictates as if they were absolutely meaningless to her.''Quite right,' he answered, approvingly. 'Quite right. I see youunderstand. A very proper spirit!'Then the Woman within me got the better of the Typewriter. 'Though Iconfess,' I continued, 'I _do_ feel it is a little unkind tosell Clara at once for whatever she will fetch. It seems tome--well--unchivalrous.'He smiled, but held his peace.'Still--the middies,' I went on: 'they will perhaps take care that thesepoor girls are not ill-treated.'He leaned back, clasped his hands, and regarded me fixedly. 'Bertha,' hesaid, after a pause, 'is Brighton A's--to be strictly correct, London,Brighton, and South Coast First Preference Debentures. Clara is Glasgowand South-Western Deferred Stock. Middies are Midland Ordinary. But Irespect your feeling. You are a young lady of principle.' And hefidgeted more than ever.[Illustration: HE WENT ON DICTATING FOR JUST AN HOUR.]He went on dictating for just an hour. His subject-matter bewildered me.It was all about India Bills, and telegraphic transfers, and sellingcotton short, and holding tight to Egyptian Unified. Markets, it seemed,were glutted. Hungarians were only to be dealt in if theyhardened--hardened sinners I know, but what are hardened Hungarians? Andfears were not unnaturally expressed that Turks might be 'irregular,'Consols, it appeared, were certain to give way for political reasons;but the downward tendency of Australians, I was relieved to learn, forthe honour of so great a group of colonies, could only be temporary.Greeks were growing decidedly worse, though I had always understoodGreeks were bad enough already; and Argentine Central were likely to beweak; but Provincials must soon become commendably firm, and if Uruguayswent flat, something good ought to be made out of them. Scotch railsmight shortly be quiet-- I always understood they were based uponsleepers; but if South-Eastern stiffened, advantage should certainly betaken of their stiffening. He would telegraph particulars on Mondaymorning. And so on till my brain reeled. Oh, artistic Florence! was_this_ the Filippo Lippi, the Michael Angelo I dreamed of?At the end of the hour, the Urbane Old Gentleman rose urbanely. He drewon his gloves again with the greatest deliberation, and hunted for hisstick as if his life depended upon it. 'Let me see; I had a pencil; oh,thanks; yes, that is it. This cover protects the point. My hat? Ah,certainly. And my notes; much obliged; notes _always_ get mislaid.People are so careless. Then I will come again to-morrow; the same hour,if you will kindly keep yourself disengaged. Though, excuse me, you hadbetter make an entry of it at once upon your agenda.''I shall remember it,' I answered, smiling.'No; will you? But you haven't my name.''I know it,' I answered. 'At least, I think so. You are Mr. MarmadukeAshurst. Lady Georgina Fawley sent you here.'He laid down his hat and gloves again, so as to regard me moreundistracted. 'You are a most remarkable young lady,' he said, in a veryslow voice. 'I impressed upon Georgina that she must not mention to youthat I was coming. How on earth did you recognise me?''Intuition, most likely.'He stared at me with a sort of suspicion. '_Please_ don't tell me youthink me like my sister,' he went on. 'For though, of course, everyright-minded man feels--ur--a natural respect and affection for themembers his family--bows, if I may so say, to the inscrutable decrees ofProvidence--which has mysteriously burdened him with them--still, there_are_ points about Lady Georgina which I cannot conscientiously assert Iapprove of.'I remembered 'Marmy's a fool,' and held my tongue judiciously.'I do not resemble her, I hope,' he persisted, with a look which I couldalmost describe as wistful.'A family likeness, perhaps,' I put in. 'Family likenesses exist, youknow--often with complete divergence of tastes and character.'He looked relieved. 'That is true. Oh, how true! But the likeness in mycase, I must admit, escapes me.'I temporised. 'Strangers see these things most,' I said, airing thestock platitudes. 'It may be superficial. And, of course, one knows thatprofound differences of intellect and moral feeling often occur withinthe limits of a single family.''You are quite right,' he said, with decision. 'Georgina's principlesare not mine. Excuse my remarking it, but you seem to be a young lady ofunusual penetration.'I saw he took my remark as a compliment. What I really meant to say wasthat a commonplace man might easily be brother to so clever a woman asLady Georgina.[Illustration: HE BOWED TO US EACH SEPARATELY.]He gathered up his hat, his stick, his gloves, his notes, and histypewritten letters, one by one, and backed out politely. He was apunctilious millionaire. He had risen by urbanity to his brotherdirectors, like a model guinea-pig. He bowed to us each separately as ifwe had been duchesses.As soon as he was gone, Elsie turned to me. 'Brownie, how on earth didyou guess it? They're so awfully different!''Not at all,' I answered. 'A few surface unlikenesses only just mask anunderlying identity. Their features are the same; but his are plump;hers, shrunken. Lady Georgina's expression is sharp and worldly; Mr.Ashurst's is smooth, and bland, and financial. And then their manner!Both are fussy; but Lady Georgina's is honest, open, ill-temperedfussiness; Mr. Ashurst's is concealed under an artificial mask ofobsequious politeness. One's cantankerous; the other's only pernicketty.It's one tune, after all, in two different keys.'From that day forth, the Urbane Old Gentleman was a daily visitor. Hetook an hour at a time at first; but after a few days, the hourlengthened out (apologetically) to an entire morning. He 'presumed toask' my Christian name the second day, and remembered my father--'a manof excellent principles.' But he didn't care for Elsie to work for him.Fortunately for her, other work dropped in, once we had found a client,or else, poor girl, she would have felt sadly slighted. I was glad shehad something to do; the sense of dependence weighed heavily upon her.The Urbane Old Gentleman did not confine himself entirely, after thefirst few days, to Stock Exchange literature. He was engaged on aWork--he spoke of it always with bated breath, and a capital letter wasimplied in his intonation; the Work was one on the Interpretation ofProphecy. Unlike Lady Georgina, who was tart and crisp, Mr. MarmadukeAshurst was devout and decorous; where she said 'pack of fools,' hetalked with unction of 'the mental deficiencies of our poorer brethren.'But his religious opinions and his stockbroking had got strangely mixedup at the wash somehow. He was convinced that the British nationrepresented the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel--and in particular Ephraim--amatter on which, as a mere lay-woman, I would not presume either toagree with him or to differ from him. 'That being so, Miss Cayley, wecan easily understand that the existing commercial prosperity of Englanddepends upon the promises made to Abraham.'I assented, without committing myself. 'It would seem to follow.'Mr. Ashurst, encouraged by so much assent, went on to unfold his Systemof Interpretation, which was of a strictly commercial orcompany-promoting character. It ran like a prospectus. 'We haveinherited the gold of Australia and the diamonds of the Cape,' he said,growing didactic, and lifting one fat forefinger; 'we are now inheritingKlondike and the Rand, for it is morally certain that we shall annex theTransvaal. Again, \\\"the chief things of the ancient mountains, and theprecious things of the everlasting hills.\\\" What does that mean? Theancient mountains are clearly the Rockies; can the everlasting hills beanything but the Himalayas? \\\"For they shall suck of the abundance of theseas\\\"--that refers, of course, to our world-wide commerce, due mainly toimports--\\\"and of the treasures hid in the sand.\\\" Which sand?Undoubtedly, I say, the desert of Mount Sinai. What then is our obviousdestiny? A lady of your intelligence must gather at once that itis----?' He paused and gazed at me.'To drive the Sultan out of Syria,' I suggested tentatively, 'and toannex Palestine to our practical province of Egypt?'He leaned back in his chair and folded his fat hands in undisguisedsatisfaction. 'Now, you are a thinker of exceptional penetration,' hebroke out. 'Do you know, Miss Cayley, I have tried to make that pointclear to the War Office, and the Prime Minister, and many leadingfinanciers in the City of London, and I _can't_ get them to see it. Theyhave no heads, those people. But _you_ catch at it at a glance. Why, Iendeavoured to interest Rothschild and induce him to join me in myPalestine Development Syndicate, and, will you believe it, the manrefused point blank. Though if he had only looked at Nahum iii. 17----''Mere financiers,' I said, smiling, 'will not consider these questionsfrom a historical and prophetic point of view. They see nothing abovepercentages.''That's it,' he replied, lighting up. 'They have no higher feelings.Though, mind you, there will be dividends too; mark my words, there willbe dividends. This syndicate, besides fulfilling the prophecies, willpay forty per cent on every penny embarked in it.''Only forty per cent for Ephraim!' I murmured, half below my breath.'Why, Judah is said to batten upon sixty.'He caught at it eagerly, without perceiving my gentle sarcasm.'In that case, we might even expect seventy,' he put in with a gasp ofanticipation. 'Though I approached Rothschild first with my scheme onpurpose, so that Israel and Judah might once more unite in sharing thepromises.''Your combined generosity and commercial instinct does you credit,' Ianswered. 'It is rare to find so much love for an abstract study side byside with such conspicuous financial ability.'His guilelessness was beyond words. He swallowed it like an infant. 'SoI think,' he answered. 'I am glad to observe that you understand mycharacter. Mere City men don't. They have no soul above shekels. Though,as I show them, there are shekels in it, too. Dividends, dividends,di-vidends. But _you_ are a lady of understanding and comprehension. Youhave been to Girton, haven't you? Perhaps you read Greek, then?''Enough to get on with.''Could you look things up in Herodotus?''Certainly?''In the original?''Oh, dear, yes.'He regarded me once more with the same astonished glance. His ownclassics, I soon learnt, were limited to the amount which a publicschool succeeds in dinning, during the intervals of cricket and footballinto an English gentleman. Then he informed me that he wished me to huntup certain facts in Herodotus \\\"and elsewhere\\\" confirmatory of his viewthat the English were the descendants of the Ten Tribes. I promised todo so, swallowing even that comprehensive \\\"elsewhere.\\\" It was none of mybusiness to believe or disbelieve: I was paid to get up a case, and Igot one up to the best of my ability. I imagine it was at least as goodas most other cases in similar matters: at any rate, it pleased the oldgentleman vastly.By dint of listening, I began to like him. But Elsie couldn't bear him.She hated the fat crease at the back of his neck, she told me.After a week or two devoted to the Interpretation of Prophecy on astrictly commercial basis of Founders' Shares, with interludes of miningengineers' reports upon the rubies of Mount Sinai and the supposedauriferous quartzites of Palestine, the Urbane Old Gentleman trotteddown to the office one day, carrying a packet of notes of mostvoluminous magnitude. \\\"Can we work in a room alone this morning, MissCayley?\\\" he asked, with mystery in his voice: he was always mysterious.\\\"I want to intrust you with a piece of work of an exceptionally privateand confidential character. It concerns Property. In point of fact,\\\" hedropped his voice to a whisper. \\\"I want you to draw up my will for me.\\\"\\\"Certainly,\\\" I said, opening the door into the back office. But Itrembled in my shoes. Could this mean that he was going to draw up awill, disinheriting Harold Tillington?And, suppose he did, what then? My heart was in a tumult. If Harold wererich--well and good, I could never marry him. But, if Harold were poor--I must keep my promise. Could I wish him to be rich? Could I wish him tobe poor? My heart stood divided two ways within me.The Urbane Old Gentleman began with immense deliberation, as befits aman of principle when Property is at stake. 'You will kindly take downnotes from my dictation,' he said, fussing with his papers; 'andafterwards, I will ask you to be so good as to copy it all out fair onyour typewriter for signature.''Is a typewritten form legal?' I ventured to inquire.'A most perspicacious young lady!' he interjected, well pleased. 'I haveinvestigated that point, and find it perfectly regular. Only, if I mayventure to say so, there should be no erasures.''There shall be none,' I answered.The Urbane Old Gentleman leant back in his easy chair, and begandictating from his notes with tantalising deliberateness. This was thelast will and testament of him, Marmaduke Courtney Ashurst. Its verbiagewearied me. I was eager for him to come to the point about Harold.Instead of that, he did what it seems is usual in such cases--set outwith a number of unimportant legacies to old family servants and otherhangers-on among 'our poorer brethren.' I fumed and fretted inwardly.Next came a series of quaint bequests of a quite novel character. 'Igive and bequeath to James Walsh and Sons, of 720 High Holborn, London,the sum of Five Hundred Pounds, in consideration of the benefit theyhave conferred upon humanity by the invention of a sugar-spoon or silversugar-sifter, by means of which it is possible to dust sugar upon atart or pudding without letting the whole or the greater part of thematerial run through the apertures uselessly in transit. You must haveobserved, Miss Cayley--with your usual perspicacity--that mostsugar-sifters allow the sugar to fall through them on to the tableprematurely.''I have noticed it,' I answered, trembling with anxiety.'James Walsh and Sons, acting on a hint from me, have succeeded ininventing a form of spoon which does not possess that regrettabledrawback. \\\"Run through the apertures uselessly in transit,\\\" I think Isaid last. Yes, thank you. Very good. We will now continue. And I giveand bequeath the like sum of Five Hundred Pounds--did I say, free oflegacy duty? No? Then please add it to James Walsh's clause. FiveHundred Pounds, free of legacy duty, to Thomas Webster Jones, of WheelerStreet, Soho, for his admirable invention of a pair of braces which willnot slip down on the wearer's shoulders after half an hour's use. Mostbraces, you must have observed, Miss Cayley----''My acquaintance with braces is limited, not to say abstract,' Iinterposed, smiling.He gazed at me, and twirled his fat thumbs.'_Of_ course,' he murmured. '_Of_ course. But most braces, you may notbe aware, slip down unpleasantly on the shoulder-blade, and so lead toan awkward habit of hitching them up by the sleeve-hole of the waistcoatat frequent intervals. Such a habit must be felt to be ungraceful.Thomas Webster Jones, to whom I pointed out this error of manufacture,has invented a brace the two halves of which diverge at a higher anglethan usual, and fasten further towards the centre of the body infront--pardon these details--so as to obviate that difficulty. He hasgiven me satisfaction, and he deserves to be rewarded.'I heard through it all the voice of Lady Georgina observing, tartly,'Why the idiots can't make braces to fit one at first passes _my_comprehension. But, there, my dear; the people who manufacture them area set of born fools, and what can you expect from an imbecile?' Mr.Ashurst was Lady Georgina, veneered with a thin layer of ingratiatingurbanity. Lady Georgina was clever, and therefore acrimonious. Mr.Ashurst was astute, and therefore obsequious.He went on with legacies to the inventor of a sauce-bottle which did notlet the last drop dribble down so as to spot the table-cloth; of ashoe-horn the handle of which did not come undone; and of a pair ofsleeve-links which you could put off and on without injury to thetemper. 'A real benefactor, Miss Cayley; a real benefactor to thelink-wearing classes; for he has sensibly diminished the average annualoutput of profane swearing.'When he left Five Hundred Pounds to his faithful servant FredericHigginson, courier, I was tempted to interpose; but I refrained in time,and I was glad of it afterwards.At last, after many divagations, my Urbane Old Gentleman arrived at thecentral point--'and I give and bequeath to my nephew, Harold AshurstTillington, Younger of Gledcliffe, Dumfriesshire, attach\\u00e9 to HerMajesty's Embassy at Rome----'[Illustration: I WAITED BREATHLESS.]I waited, breathless.He was annoyingly dilatory. 'My house and estate of Ashurst Court, inthe County of Gloucester, and my town house at 24 Park Lane North, inLondon, together with the residue of all my estate, real orpersonal----' and so forth.I breathed again. At least, I had not been called upon to disinheritHarold.'Provided always----' he went on, in the same voice.I wondered what was coming.'Provided always that the said Harold Ashurst Tillington does notmarry----leave a blank there, Miss Cayley. I will find out the name ofthe young person I desire to exclude, and fill it in afterward. I don'trecollect it at this moment, but Higginson, no doubt, will be able tosupply the deficiency. In fact, I don't think I ever heard it; thoughHigginson has told me all about the woman.''Higginson?' I inquired. 'Is he here?''Oh, dear, yes. You heard of him, I suppose, from Georgina. Georgina isprejudiced. He has come back to me, I am glad to say. An excellentservant, Higginson, though a trifle too omniscient. All men are equal inthe eyes of their Maker, of course; but we must have due subordination.A courier ought not to be better informed than his master--or ought atleast to conceal the fact dexterously. Well, Higginson knows this youngperson's name; my sister wrote to me about her disgraceful conduct whenshe first went to Schlangenbad. An adventuress, it seems; anadventuress; quite a shocking creature. Foisted herself upon LadyGeorgina in Kensington Gardens--unintroduced, if you can believe such athing--with the most astonishing effrontery; and Georgina, who willforgive anything on earth, for the sake of what she callsoriginality--another name for impudence, as I am sure you mustknow--took the young woman with her as her maid to Germany. There, thisminx tried to set her cap at my nephew Harold, who can be caught at onceby a pretty face; and Harold was bowled over--almost got engaged to her.Georgina took a fancy to the girl later, having a taste for dubiouspeople (I cannot say I approve of Georgina's friends), and wrote againto say her first suspicions were unfounded: the young woman was inreality a paragon of virtue. But _I_ know better than that. Georgina hasno judgment. I regret to be obliged to confess it, but cleverness, Ifear, is the only thing in the world my excellent sister cares for. Thehussy, it seems, was certainly clever. Higginson has told me about her.He says her bare appearance would suffice to condemn her--a bold, fast,shameless, brazen-faced creature. But you will forgive me, I am sure, mydear young lady: I ought not to discuss such painted Jezebels beforeyou. We will leave this person's name blank. I will not sully yourpen--I mean, your typewriter--by asking you to transcribe it.'I made up my mind at once. 'Mr. Ashurst,' I said, looking up from mykeyboard, '_I_ can give you this girl's name; and then you can insertthe proviso immediately.''_You_ can? My dear young lady, what a wonderful person you are! Youseem to know everybody, and everything. But perhaps she was atSchlangenbad with Lady Georgina, and you were there also?''She was,' I answered, deliberately. 'The name you want is--LoisCayley!'He let his notes drop in his astonishment.I went on with my typewriting, unmoved. 'Provided always that the saidHarold Ashurst Tillington does not marry Lois Cayley; in which case Iwill and desire that the said estate shall pass to----whom shall I putin, Mr. Ashurst?'He leant forward with his fat hands on his ample knees. 'It was really_you_?' he inquired, open-mouthed.I nodded. 'There is no use in denying the truth. Mr. Tillington did askme to be his wife, and I refused him.''But, my dear Miss Cayley----''The difference in station?' I said; 'the difference, still greater, inthis world's goods? Yes, I know. I admit all that. So I declined hisoffer. I did not wish to ruin his prospects.'The Urbane Old Gentleman eyed me with a sudden tenderness in his glance.'Young men are lucky,' he said, slowly, after a short pause; '--and--Higginson is an idiot. I say it deliberately--an idiot! How could onedream of trusting the judgment of a flunkey about a lady? My dear,excuse the familiarity from one who may consider himself in a certainsense a contingent uncle--suppose we amend the last clause by theomission of the word _not_. It strikes me as superfluous. \\\"Providedalways the said Harold Ashurst Tillington consents to marry\\\"-- I thinkthat sounds better!'He looked at me with such fatherly regard that it pricked my heart everto have poked fun at his Interpretation of Prophecy on Stock Exchangeprinciples. I think I flushed crimson. 'No, no,' I answered, firmly.'That will not do either, please. That's worse than the other way. Youmust not put it, Mr. Ashurst. I could not consent to be willed away toanybody.'He leant forward, with real earnestness. 'My dear,' he said, 'that's notthe point. Pardon my reminding you that you are here in your capacity asmy amanuensis. I am drawing up my will, and if you will allow me to sayso, I cannot admit that anyone has a claim to influence me in thedisposition of my Property.''_Please!_' I cried, pleadingly.He looked at me and paused. 'Well,' he went on at last, after a longinterval; 'since _you_ insist upon it, I will leave the bequest to standwithout condition.''Thank you,' I murmured, bending low over my machine.''If I did as I like, though,' he went on, 'I should say, Unless hemarries Miss Lois Cayley (who is a deal too good for him) the estateshall revert to Kynaston's eldest son, a confounded jackass. I do notusually indulge in intemperate language; but I desire to assure you,with the utmost calmness, that Kynaston's eldest son, Lord Southminster,is a con-founded jackass.'I rose and took his hand in my own spontaneously. 'Mr. Ashurst,' I said,'you may interpret prophecy as long as ever you like, but you are a dearkind old gentleman. I am truly grateful to you for your good opinion.'And you will marry Harold?''Never,' I answered; 'while he is rich. I have said as much to him.''That's hard,' he went on, slowly. 'For ... I should like to be youruncle.'I trembled all over. Elsie saved the situation by bursting in abruptly.I will only add that when Mr. Ashurst left, I copied the will outneatly, without erasures. The rough original I threw (somewhatcarelessly) into the waste-paper basket.That afternoon, somebody called to fetch the fair copy for Mr. Ashurst.I went out into the front office to see him. To my surprise, it wasHigginson--in his guise as courier.[Illustration: WHAT, YOU HERE! HE CRIED.]He was as astonished as myself. 'What, _you_ here!' he cried. 'You dogme!''I was thinking the same thing of you, M. le Comte,' I answered,curtsying.He made no attempt at an excuse. 'Well, I have been sent for the will,'he broke out, curtly.'And you were sent for the jewel-case,' I retorted. 'No, no, Dr.Fortescue-Langley; _I_ am in charge of the will, and I will take itmyself to Mr. Ashurst.''I will be even with you yet,' he snapped out. 'I have gone back to myold trade, and am trying to lead an honest life; but _you_ won't letme.''On the contrary,' I answered, smiling a polite smile. 'I rejoice tohear it. If you say nothing more against me to your employer, I will notdisclose to him what I know about you. But if you slander me, I will. Sonow we understand one another.'And I kept the will till I could give it myself into Mr Ashurst's ownhands in his rooms that evening.VIITHE ADVENTURE OF THE UNOBTRUSIVE OASISI will not attempt to describe to you the minor episodes of our nexttwelve months--the manuscripts we type-wrote and the Manitous we sold.'Tis one of my aims in a world so rich in bores to avoid being tedious.I will merely say, therefore, that we spent the greater part of the yearin Florence, where we were building up a connection, but rode back forthe summer months to Switzerland, as being a livelier place for thetrade in bicycles. The net result was not only that we covered ourexpenses, but that, as chancellor of the exchequer, I found myself witha surplus in hand at the end of the season.When we returned to Florence for the winter, however, I confess I beganto chafe. 'This is slow work, Elsie!' I said. 'I started out to go roundthe world; it has taken me eighteen months to travel no further thanItaly! At this rate, I shall reach New York a gray-haired old lady, in anice lace cap, and totter back into London a venerable crone on theverge of ninety.'However, those invaluable doctors came to my rescue unexpectedly. I dolove doctors; they are always sending you off at a moment's notice todelightful places you never dreamt of. Elsie was better, but still farfrom strong. I took it upon me to consult our medical attendant; andhis verdict was decisive. He did just what a doctor ought to do. 'She isgetting on very well in Florence,' he said; 'but if you want to restoreher health completely, I should advise you to take her for a winter toEgypt. After six months of the dry, warm desert air, I don't doubt shemight return to her work in London.'That last point I used as a lever with Elsie. She positively revels inteaching mathematics. At first, to be sure, she objected that we hadonly just money enough to pay our way to Cairo, and that when we gotthere we might starve--her favourite programme. I have not thisextraordinary taste for starving; _my_ idea is, to go where you like,and find something decent to eat when you get there. However, to humourher, I began to cast about me for a source of income. There is noabsolute harm in seeing your way clear before you for a twelvemonth,though of course it deprives you of the plot-interest of poverty.'Elsie,' I said, in my best didactic style--I excel in didactics--'youdo not learn from the lessons that life sets before you. Look at thestage, for example; the stage is universally acknowledged at the presentday to be a great teacher of morals. Does not Irving say so?--and heought to know. There is that splendid model for imitation, for instance,the Clown in the pantomime. How does Clown regulate his life? Does hetake heed for the morrow? Not a bit of it! \\\"I wish I had a goose,\\\" hesays, at some critical juncture; and just as he says it--pat--a superstrolls upon the stage with a property goose on a wooden tray; and Clowncries, \\\"Oh, look here, Joey; _here's_ a goose!\\\" and proceeds toappropriate it. Then he puts his fingers in his mouth and observes, \\\"Iwish I had a few apples to make the sauce with\\\"; and as the words escapehim--pat again--a small boy with a very squeaky voice runs on, carryinga basket of apples. Clown trips him up, and bolts with the basket._There's_ a model for imitation! The stage sets these great morallessons before you regularly every Christmas; yet you fail to profit bythem. Govern your life on the principles exemplified by Clown; expect tofind that whatever you want will turn up with punctuality and dispatchat the proper moment. Be adventurous and you will be happy. Take that asa new maxim to put in your copy-book!''I wish I could think so, dear,' Elsie answered. 'But your confidencestaggers me.'That evening at our _table-d'h\\u00f4te_, however, it was amply justified. Asmooth-faced young man of ample girth and most prosperous exteriorhappened to sit next us. He had his wife with him, so I judged it safeto launch on conversation. We soon found out he was the millionaireeditor-proprietor of a great London daily, with many more strings to hisjournalistic bow; his honoured name was Elworthy. I mentioned casuallythat we thought of going for the winter to Egypt. He pricked his earsup. But at the time he said nothing. After dinner, we adjourned to thecosy _salon_. I talked to him and his wife; and somehow, that evening,the devil entered into me. I am subject to devils. I hasten to add, theyare mild ones. I had one of my reckless moods just then, however, and Ireeled off rattling stories of our various adventures. Mr. Elworthybelieved in youth and audacity; I could see I interested him. The morehe was amused, the more reckless I became. 'That's bright,' he said atlast, when I told him the tale of our amateur exploits in the sale ofManitous. 'That would make a good article!''Yes,' I answered, with bravado, determined to strike while the ironwas hot. 'What the _Daily Telephone_ lacks is just one enlivening touchof feminine brightness.'He smiled. 'What is your forte?' he inquired.'My forte,' I answered, 'is--to go where I choose, and write what I likeabout it.'He smiled again. 'And a very good new departure in journalism, too! Aroving commission! Have you ever tried your hand at writing?'Had I ever tried! It was the ambition of my life to see myself in print;though, hitherto, it had been ineffectual. 'I have written a fewsketches,' I answered, with becoming modesty. As a matter of fact, ouroffice bulged with my unpublished manuscripts.'Could you let me see them?' he asked.I assented, with inner joy, but outer reluctance. 'If you wish it,' Imurmured; 'but--you must be _very_ lenient!'[Illustration: HE READ THEM, CRUEL MAN, BEFORE MY VERY EYES.]Though I had not told Elsie, the truth of the matter was, I had justthen conceived an idea for a novel--my _magnum opus_--the setting ofwhich compelled Egyptian local colour; and I was therefore dying to getto Egypt, if chance so willed it. I submitted a few of my pickedmanuscripts accordingly to Mr. Elworthy, in fear and trembling. He readthem, cruel man, before my very eyes; I sat and waited, twiddling mythumbs, demure but apprehensive.When he had finished, he laid them down.'Racy!' he said. 'Racy! You're quite right, Miss Cayley. That's justwhat we want on the _Daily Telephone_. I should like to print thesethree,' selecting them out, 'at our usual rate of pay per thousand.''You are very kind.' But the room reeled with me.'Not at all. I am a man of business. And these are good copy. Now, aboutthis Egypt. I will put the matter in the shape of a businessproposition. Will you undertake, if I pay your passage, and yourfriend's, with all travelling expenses, to let me have three descriptivearticles a week, on Cairo, the Nile, Syria, and India, running to abouttwo thousand words apiece, at three guineas a thousand?'My breath came and went. It was positive opulence. The super with thegoose couldn't approach it for patness. My editor had brought me theapple sauce as well, without even giving me the trouble of cooking it.The very next day everything was arranged. Elsie tried to protest, onthe foolish ground that she had no money: but the faculty had orderedthe apex of her right lung to go to Egypt, and I couldn't let her fly inthe face of the faculty. We secured our berths in a P. and O. steamerfrom Brindisi; and within a week we were tossing upon the bosom of theblue Mediterranean.People who haven't crossed the blue Mediterranean cherish an absurd ideathat it is always calm and warm and sunny. I am sorry to take away anysea's character; but I speak of it as I find it (to borrow a phrase frommy old gyp at Girton); and I am bound to admit that the Mediterraneandid not treat me as a lady expects to be treated. It behaveddisgracefully. People may rhapsodize as long as they choose about a lifeon the ocean wave; for my own part, I wouldn't give a pin forsea-sickness. We glided down the Adriatic from Brindisi to Corfu with areckless profusion of lateral motion which suggested the idea that theship must have been drinking.I tried to rouse Elsie when we came abreast of the Ionian Islands, andto remind her that 'Here was the home of Nausicaa in the Odyssey.' Elsiefailed to respond; she was otherwise occupied. At last, I succumbed andgave it up. I remember nothing further till a day and a half later, whenwe got under lee of Crete, and the ship showed a tendency to resume theperpendicular. Then I began once more to take a languid interest in thedinner question.I may add parenthetically that the Mediterranean is a mere bit of a sea,when you look at it on the map--a pocket sea, to be regarded withmingled contempt and affection; but you learn to respect it when youfind that it takes four clear days and nights of abject misery merely torun across its eastern basin from Brindisi to Alexandria. I respectedthe Mediterranean immensely while we lay off the Peloponnesus in thetrough of the waves with a north wind blowing; I only began to temper myrespect with a distant liking when we passed under the welcome shelterof Crete on a calm, star-lit evening.It was deadly cold. We had not counted upon such weather in the sunnysouth. I recollected now that the Greeks were wont to represent Boreasas a chilly deity, and spoke of the Thracian breeze with the samedeferentially deprecating adjectives which we ourselves apply to theeast wind of our fatherland; but that apt classical memory somehowfailed to console or warm me. A good-natured male passenger, however,volunteered to ask us, 'Will I get ye a rug, ladies?' The form of hiscourteous question suggested the probability of his Irish origin.'You are very kind,' I answered. 'If you don't want it for yourself, I'msure my friend would be glad to have the use of it.''Is it meself? Sure I've got me big ulsther, and I'm as warrum as atoast in it. But ye're not provided for this weather. Ye've thrusted toomuch to those rascals the po-uts. 'Where breaks the blue Sicilian say,'the rogues write. _I'd_ like to set them down in it, wid a nor'-easterblowing!'He fetched up his rug. It was ample and soft, a smooth brown camel-hair.He wrapped us both up in it. We sat late on deck that night, as warm asa toast ourselves, thanks to our genial Irishman.[Illustration: 'TIS DOCTOR MACLOGHLEN, HE ANSWERED.]We asked his name. ''Tis Dr. Macloghlen,' he answered. 'I'm from CountyClare, ye see; and I'm on me way to Egypt for thravel and exploration.Me fader whisht me to see the worruld a bit before I'd settle down topractise me profession at Liscannor. Have ye ever been in County Clare?Sure, 'tis the pick of Oireland.''We have that pleasure still in store,' I answered, smiling. 'It spreadsgold-leaf over the future, as George Meredith puts it.''Is it Meredith? Ah, there's the foine writer! 'Tis jaynius the man has:I can't undtherstand a word of him. But he's half Oirish, ye know. Whatproof have I got of it? An' would he write like that if there wasn't adhrop of the blood of the Celt in him?'Next day and next night, Mr. Macloghlen was our devoted slave. I had wonhis heart by admitting frankly that his countrywomen had the finest andliveliest eyes in Europe--eyes with a deep twinkle, half fun, halfpassion. He took to us at once, and talked to us incessantly. He was ared-haired, raw-boned Munster-man, but a real good fellow. We forgot theaggressive inequalities of the Mediterranean while he talked to us of'the pizzantry.' Late the second evening he propounded a confidence. Itwas a lovely night; Orion overhead, and the plashing phosphorescence onthe water below conspired with the hour to make him speciallyconfidential. 'Now, Miss Cayley,' he said, leaning forward on his deckchair, and gazing earnestly into my eyes, 'there's wan question I'd liketo ask ye. The ambition of me life is to get into Parlimint. And I wantto know from ye, as a frind--if I accomplish me heart's wish--is thereannything, in me apparence, ar in me voice, ar in me accent, ar in memanner, that would lade annybody to suppose I was an Oirishman?'I succeeded, by good luck, in avoiding Elsie's eye. What on earth couldI answer? Then a happy thought struck me. 'Dr. Macloghlen,' I said, 'itwould not be the slightest use your trying to conceal it; for even ifnobody ever detected a faint Irish intonation in your words orphrases--how could your eloquence fail to betray you for a countryman ofSheridan and Burke and Grattan?'He seized my hand with such warmth that I thought it best to hurry downto my state-room at once, under cover of my compliment.At Alexandria and Cairo we found him invaluable. He looked after ourluggage, which he gallantly rescued from the lean hands of fifteen Arabporters, all eagerly struggling to gain possession of our effects; hesaw us safe into the train; and he never quitted us till he had safelyensconced us in our rooms at Shepheard's. For himself, he said, withsubdued melancholy, 'twas to some cheaper hotel he must go; Shepheard'swasn't for the likes of him; though if land in County Clare was wort'what it ought to be, there wasn't a finer estate in all Oireland thanhis fader's.Our Mr. Elworthy was a modern proprietor, who knew how to do things onthe lordly scale. Having commissioned me to write this series ofarticles, he intended them to be written in the first style of art, andhe had instructed me accordingly to hire one of Cook's little steamdahabeeahs, where I could work at leisure. Dr. Macloghlen was in hiselement arranging for the trip. 'Sure the only thing I mind,' he said,'is--that I'll not be going wid ye.' I think he was half inclined toinvite himself; but there again I drew a line. I will not sell saltfish; and I will not go up the Nile, unchaperoned, with a casual manacquaintance.He did the next best thing, however: he took a place in a sailingdahabeeah; and as we steamed up slowly, stopping often on the way, togive me time to write my articles, he managed to arrive almost always atevery town or ruin exactly when we did.I will not describe the voyage. The Nile is the Nile. Just at first,before we got used to it, we conscientiously looked up the name of everyvillage we passed on the bank in our Murray and our Baedeker. After acouple of days' Niling, however, we found that formality quiteunnecessary. They were all the same village, under a number of aliases.They did not even take the trouble to disguise themselves anew, like Dr.Fortescue-Langley, on each fresh appearance. They had every one of thema small whitewashed mosque, with a couple of tall minarets; and aroundit spread a number of mud-built cottages, looking more like bee-hivesthan human habitations. They had also every one of them a group ofdate-palms, overhanging a cluster of mean bare houses; and they allalike had a picturesque and even imposing air from a distance, but fadedaway into indescribable squalor as one got abreast of them. Our progresswas monotonous. At twelve, noon, we would pass Aboo-Teeg, with itsmosque, its palms, its mud-huts, and its camels; then for a couple ofhours we would go on through the midst of a green field on either side,studded by more mud-huts, and backed up by a range of gray desertmountains; only to come at 2 P.M., twenty miles higher up, uponAboo-Teeg once more, with the same mosque, the same mud-huts, and thesame haughty camels, placidly chewing the same aristocratic cud, butunder the alias of Koos-kam. After a wild hubbub at the quay, we wouldleave Koos-kam behind, with its camels still serenely munchingday-before-yesterday's dinner; and twenty miles further on, again,having passed through the same green plain, backed by the same graymountains, we would stop once more at the identical Koos-kam, which thistime absurdly described itself as Tahtah. But whether it was Aboo-Teegor Koos-kam or Tahtah or anything else, only the name differed: it wasalways the same town, and had always the same camels at precisely thesame stage of the digestive process. It seemed to us immaterial whetheryou saw all the Nile or only five miles of it. It was just likewall-paper. A sample sufficed; the whole was the sample infinitelyrepeated.However, I had my letters to write, and I wrote them valiantly. Idescribed the various episodes of the complicated digestive process inthe camel in the minutest detail. I gloated over the date-palms, which Iknew in three days as if I had been brought up upon dates. I gaveword-pictures of every individual child, veiled woman, Arab sheikh, andCoptic priest whom we encountered on the voyage. And I am open toreprint those conscientious studies of mud-huts and minarets with anyenterprising publisher who will make me an offer.[Illustration: TOO MUCH NILE.]Another disillusion weighed upon my soul. Before I went up the Nile, Ihad a fancy of my own that the bank was studded with endless ruinedtemples, whose vast red colonnades were reflected in the water at everyturn. I think Macaulay's Lays were primarily answerable for thatparticular misapprehension. As a matter of fact, it surprised me to findthat we often went for two whole days' hard steaming without ever atemple breaking the monotony of those eternal date-palms, those calm andsuperciliously irresponsive camels. In my humble opinion, Egypt is afraud; there is too much Nile--very dirty Nile at that--and not nearlyenough temple. Besides, the temples, when you _do_ come up with them,are just like the villages; they are the same temple over again, under adifferent name each time, and they have the same gods, the same kings,the same wearisome bas-reliefs, except that the gentleman in a chariot,ten feet high, who is mowing down enemies a quarter his own size, withunsportsmanslike recklessness, is called Rameses in this place, andSethi in that, and Amen-hotep in the other. With this triflingvariation, when you have seen one temple, one obelisk, one hieroglyphictable, you have seen the whole of Ancient Egypt.At last, after many days' voyage through the same scenery daily--risingin the morning off a village with a mosque, ten palms, and two minarets,and retiring late at night off the same village once more, with mosque,palms, and minarets, as before, _da capo_--we arrived one evening at aplace called Geergeh. In itself, I believe, Geergeh did not differmaterially from all the other places we had passed on our voyage: it hadits mosque, its ten palms, and its two minarets as usual. But I rememberits name, because something mysterious went wrong there with ourmachinery; and the engineer informed us we must wait at least three daysto mend it. Dr. Macloghlen's dahabeeah happened opportunely to arriveat the same spot on the same day; and he declared with fervour he would'see us through our throubles.' But what on earth were we to do withourselves through three long days and nights at Geergeh? There were theruins of Abydus close at hand, to be sure; though I defy anybody not aprofessed Egyptologist to give more than one day to the ruins of Abydus.In this emergency, Dr. Macloghlen came gallantly to our aid. Hediscovered by inquiring from an English-speaking guide that there was anunobtrusive oasis, never visited by Europeans, one long day's journeyoff, across the desert. As a rule, it takes at least three days to getcamels and guides together for such an expedition: for Egypt is not aland to hurry in. But the indefatigable Doctor further unearthed thefact that a sheikh had just come in, who (for a consideration) wouldlend us camels for a two days' trip; and we seized the chance to do ourduty by Mr. Elworthy and the world-wide circulation. An unvisitedoasis--and two Christian ladies to be the first to explore it: there'sjournalistic enterprise for you! If we happened to be killed, so muchthe better for the _Daily Telephone_. I pictured the excitement atPiccadilly Circus. 'Extra Special, Our Own Correspondent brutallymurdered!' I rejoiced at the opportunity.I cannot honestly say that Elsie rejoiced with me. She cherished aprejudice against camels, massacres, and the new journalism. She didn'tlike being murdered: though this was premature, for she had never triedit. She objected that the fanatical Mohammedans of the Senoosi sect, whowere said to inhabit the oasis in question, might cut our throats fordogs of infidels. I pointed out to her at some length that it was justthat chance which added zest to our expedition as a journalisticventure: fancy the glory of being the first lady journalists martyred inthe cause! But she failed to grasp this aspect of the question.However, if I went, she would go too, she said, like a dear girl thatshe is: she would not desert me when I was getting my throat cut.[Illustration: EMPHASIS.]Dr. Macloghlen made the bargain for us, and insisted on accompanying usacross the desert. He told us his method of negotiation with the Arabswith extreme gusto. '\\\"Is it pay in advance ye want?\\\" says I to the dirtybeggars: \\\"divvil a penny will ye get till ye bring these ladies safeback to Geergeh. And remimber, Mr. Sheikh,\\\" says I, fingering me pistol,so, by way of emphasis, \\\"we take no money wid us; so if yer friends atWadi Bou choose to cut our throats, 'tis for the pleasure of it they'llbe cutting them, not for anything they'll gain by it.\\\" \\\"Provisions,effendi?\\\" says he, salaaming. \\\"Provisions, is it?\\\" says I. \\\"Takeeverything ye'll want wid you; I suppose ye can buy food fit for aCrischun in the bazaar in Geergeh; and never wan penny do ye touch forit all till ye've landed us on the bank again, as safe as ye took us. Soif the religious sintiments of the faithful at Wadi Bou should lade themto hack us to pieces,\\\" says I, just waving me revolver, \\\"thin 'tisyerself that will be out of pocket by it.\\\" And the ould divvil cringedas if he took me for the Prince of Wales. Faix, 'tis the purse that'sthe best argumint to catch these haythen Arabs upon.'When we set out for the desert in the early dawn next day, it looked asif we were starting for a few months' voyage. We had a company of camelsthat might have befitted a caravan. We had two large tents, one forourselves, and one for Dr. Macloghlen, with a third to dine in. We hadbedding, and cushions, and drinking water tied up in swollen pig-skins,which were really goat-skins, looking far from tempting. We had breadand meat, and a supply of presents to soften the hearts and weaken thereligious scruples of the sheikhs at Wadi Bou. 'We thravel _en prince_,'said the Doctor. When all was ready we got under way solemnly, ourcamels rising and sniffing the breeze with a superior air, as who shouldsay, 'I happen to be going where you happen to be going; but don't for amoment suppose I do it to please you. It is mere coincidence. You arebound for Wadi Bou: I have business of my own which chances to take methere.'[Illustration: RIDING A CAMEL DOES NOT GREATLY DIFFER PROMSEA-SICKNESS.]Over the incidents of the journey I draw a veil. Riding a camel, I find,does not greatly differ from sea-sickness. They are the same phenomenonunder altered circumstances. We had been assured beforehand onexcellent authority that 'much of the comfort on a desert journeydepends upon having a good camel.' On this matter, I am no authority. Ido not set up as a judge of camel-flesh. But I did not notice _any_ ofthe comfort; so I venture to believe my camel must have been anexceptionally bad one.We expected trouble from the fanatical natives; I am bound to admit, wehad most trouble with Elsie. She was not insubordinate, but she did notcare for camel-riding. And her beast took advantage of her youth andinnocence. A well-behaved camel should go almost as fast as a child canwalk, and should not sit down plump on the burning sand without duereason. Elsie's brute crawled, and called halts for prayer at frequentintervals; it tried to kneel like a good Mussulman many times a day; andit showed an intolerant disposition to crush the infidel by rolling overon top of Elsie. Dr. Macloghlen admonished it with Irish eloquence, notalways in language intended for publication; but it only turned up itssupercilious lip and inquired in its own unspoken tongue what _he_ knewabout the desert.'I feel like a wurrum before the baste,' the Doctor said, nonplussed.If the Nile was monotonous, the road to Wadi Bou was nothing short ofdreary. We crossed a great ridge of bare, gray rock, and followed arolling valley of sand, scored by dry ravines, and baking in the sun. Itwas ghastly to look upon. All day long, save at the midday rest by somebrackish wells, we rode on and on, the brutes stepping forward withslow, outstretched legs; though sometimes we walked by the camels' sidesto vary the monotony; but ever through that dreary upland plain, sand inthe centre, rocky mountain at the edge, and not a thing to look at. Wewere relieved towards evening to stumble against stunted tamarisks,half buried in sand, and to feel we were approaching the edge of theoasis.When at last our arrogant beasts condescended to stop, in theirpatronising way, we saw by the dim light of the moon a sort of unevenbasin or hollow, studded with date-palms, and in the midst of thedepression a crumbling walled town, with a whitewashed mosque, twominarets by its side, and a crowd of mud-houses. It was strangelyfamiliar. We had come all this way just to see Aboo-Teeg or Koos-kamover again!We camped outside the fortified town that night. Next morning we essayedto make our entry.At first, the servants of the Prophet on watch at the gate raisedserious objections. No infidel might enter. But we had a pass fromCairo, exhorting the faithful in the name of the Khedive to give us foodand shelter; and after much examination and many loud discussions, thegatemen passed us. We entered the town, and stood alone, three ChristianEuropeans, in the midst of three thousand fanatical Mohammedans.I confess it was weird. Elsie shrank by my side. 'Suppose they were toattack us, Brownie?''Thin the sheikh here would never get paid,' Dr. Macloghlen put in withtrue Irish recklessness. 'Faix, he'll whistle for his money on thewhistle I gave him.' That touch of humour saved us. We laughed; and thepeople about saw we could laugh. They left off scowling, and pressedaround trying to sell us pottery and native brooches. In the intervalsof fanaticism, the Arab has an eye to business.We passed up the chief street of the bazaar. The inhabitants told us inpantomime the chief of the town was away at Asioot, whither he had gonetwo days ago on business. If he were here, our interpreter gave us tounderstand, things might have been different; for the chief haddetermined that, whatever came, no infidel dog should settle in _his_oasis.[Illustration: HER AGITATION WAS EVIDENT.]The women with their veiled faces attracted us strangely. They werewilder than on the river. They ran when one looked at them. Suddenly,as we passed one, we saw her give a little start. She was veiled likethe rest, but her agitation was evident even through her thick covering.'She is afraid of Christians,' Elsie cried, nestling towards me.The woman passed close to us. She never looked in our direction, but ina very low voice she murmured, as she passed, 'Then you are English!'I had presence of mind enough to conceal my surprise at this unexpectedutterance. 'Don't seem to notice her, Elsie,' I said, looking away.'Yes, we are English.'She stopped and pretended to examine some jewellery on a stall. 'So amI,' she went on, in the same suppressed low voice. 'For Heaven's sake,help me!''What are you doing here?''I live here--married. I was with Gordon's force at Khartoum. Theycarried me off. A mere girl then. Now I am thirty.''And you have been here ever since?'She turned away and walked off, but kept whispering behind her veil. Wefollowed, unobtrusively. 'Yes; I was sold to a man at Dongola. He passedme on again to the chief of this oasis. I don't know where it is; but Ihave been here ever since. I hate this life. Is there any chance of arescue?''Anny chance of a rescue, is it?' the Doctor broke in, a trifle tooostensibly. 'If it costs us a whole British Army, me dear lady, we'llfetch you away and save you.''But now--to-day? You won't go away and leave me? You are the firstEuropeans I have seen since Khartoum fell. They may sell me again. Youwill not desert me?''No,' I said. 'We will not.' Then I reflected a moment.What on earth could we do? This was a painful dilemma. If we once lostsight of her, we might not see her again. Yet if we walked with heropenly, and talked like friends, we would betray ourselves, and her, tothose fanatical Senoosis.I made my mind up promptly. I may not have much of a mind; but, such asit is, I flatter myself I can make it up at a moment's notice.'Can you come to us outside the gate at sunset?' I asked, as if speakingto Elsie.The woman hesitated. 'I think so.''Then keep us in sight all day, and when evening comes, stroll outbehind us.'She turned over some embroidered slippers on a booth, and seemed to beinspecting them. 'But my children?' she murmured anxiously.The Doctor interposed. 'Is it childern she has?' he asked. 'Thin they'llbe the Mohammedan gintleman's. We mustn't interfere wid _them_. We cantake away the lady--she's English, and detained against her will: but wecan't deprive anny man of his own childern'.I was firm, and categorical. 'Yes, we can,' I said, stoutly; 'if he hasforced a woman to bear them to him whether she would or not. That'scommon justice. I have no respect for the Mohammedan gentleman's rights.Let her bring them with her. How many are there?''Two--a boy and girl; not very old; the eldest is seven.' She spokewistfully. A mother is a mother.'Then say no more now, but keep us always in sight, and we will keep_you_. Come to us at the gate about sundown. We will carry you off withus.'She clasped her hands and moved off with the peculiar gliding air of theveiled Mohammedan woman. Our eyes followed her. We walked on throughthe bazaar, thinking of nothing else now. It was strange how thisepisode made us forget our selfish fears for our own safety. Even deartimid Elsie remembered only that an Englishwoman's life and liberty wereat stake. We kept her more or less in view all day. She glided in andout among the people in the alleys. When we went back to the camels atlunch-time, she followed us unobtrusively through the open gate, and satwatching us from a little way off, among a crowd of gazers; for all WadiBou was of course agog at this unwonted invasion.We discussed the circumstance loudly, so that she might hear our plans.Dr. Macloghlen advised that we should tell our sheikh we meant to returnpart of the way to Geergeh that evening by moonlight. I quite agreedwith him. It was the only way out. Besides, I didn't like the looks ofthe people. They eyed us askance. This was getting exciting now. I felta professional journalistic interest. Whether we escaped or got killed,what splendid business for the _Daily Telephone_!The sheikh, of course, declared it was impossible to start that evening.The men wouldn't move--the camels needed rest. But Dr. Macloghlen wasinexorable. 'Very well, thin, Mr. Sheikh,' he answered, philosophically.'Ye'll plaze yerself about whether ye come on wid us or whether yeshtop. That's yer own business. But _we_ set out at sundown; and whin yereturn by yerself on foot to Geergeh, ye can ask for yer camels at theBritish Consulate.'All through that anxious afternoon we sat in our tents, under the shadeof the mud-wall, wondering whether we could carry out our plan or not.About an hour before sunset the veiled woman strolled out of the gatewith her two children. She joined the crowd of sight-seers once more,for never through the day were we left alone for a second. Theexcitement grew intense. Elsie and I moved up carelessly towards thegroup, talking as if to one another. I looked hard at Elsie: then Isaid, as though I were speaking about one of the children, 'Go straightalong the road to Geergeh till you are past the big clump of palms atthe edge of the oasis. Just beyond it comes a sharp ridge of rock. Waitbehind the ridge where no one can see you. When we get there,' I pattedthe little girl's head, 'don't say a word, but jump on my camel. My twofriends will each take one of the children. If you understand andconsent, stroke your boy's curls. We will accept that for a signal.'She stroked the child's head at once without the least hesitation. Eventhrough her veil and behind her dress, I could somehow feel and see hertrembling nerves, her beating heart. But she gave no overt token. Shemerely turned and muttered something carelessly in Arabic to a womanbeside her.We waited once more, in long-drawn suspense. Would she manage to escapethem? Would they suspect her motives?After ten minutes, when we had returned to our crouching-place under theshadow of the wall, the woman detached herself slowly from the group,and began strolling with almost overdone nonchalance along the road toGeergeh. We could see the little girl was frightened and seemed toexpostulate with her mother: fortunately, the Arabs about were too muchoccupied in watching the suspicious strangers to notice this episode oftheir own people. Presently, our new friend disappeared; and, withbeating hearts, we awaited the sunset.[Illustration: CROUCHING BY THE ROCKS SAT OUR MYSTERIOUS STRANGER.]Then came the usual scene of hubbub with the sheikh, the camels, theporters, and the drivers. It was eagerness against apathy. Withdifficulty we made them understand we meant to get under way at allhazards. I stormed in bad Arabic. The Doctor inveighed in very choiceIrish. At last they yielded, and set out. One by one the camels rose,bent their slow knees, and began to stalk in their lordly way withoutstretched necks along the road to the river. We moved through thepalm groves, a crowd of boys following us and shouting for backsheesh.We began to be afraid they would accompany us too far and discover ourfugitive; but fortunately they all turned back with one accord at alittle whitewashed shrine near the edge of the oasis. We reached theclump of palms; we turned the corner of the ridge. Had we missed oneanother? No! There, crouching by the rocks, with her children by herside, sat our mysterious stranger.The Doctor was equal to the emergency. 'Make those bastes kneel!' hecried authoritatively to the sheikh.The sheikh was taken aback. This was a new exploit burst upon him. Heflung his arms up, gesticulating wildly. The Doctor, unmoved, made thedrivers understand by some strange pantomime what he wanted. Theynodded, half terrified. In a second, the stranger was by my side, Elsiehad taken the girl, the Doctor the boy, and the camels were passivelybeginning to rise again. That is the best of your camel. Once set him onhis road, and he goes mechanically.The sheikh broke out with several loud remarks in Arabic, which we didnot understand, but whose hostile character could not easily escape us.He was beside himself with anger. Then I was suddenly aware of thesplendid advantage of having an Irishman on our side. Dr. Macloghlendrew his revolver, like one well used to such episodes, and pointed itfull at the angry Arab. 'Look here, Mr. Sheikh,' he said, calmly, yetwith a fine touch of bravado; 'do ye see this revolver? Well, unless yemake yer camels thravel sthraight to Geergeh widout wan other wurrud,'tis yer own brains will be spattered, sor, on the sand of this desert!And if ye touch wan hair of our heads, ye'll answer for it wid yer lifeto the British Government.'I do not feel sure that the sheikh comprehended the exact nature of eachword in this comprehensive threat, but I am certain he took in itsgeneral meaning, punctuated as it was with some flourishes of therevolver. He turned to the drivers and made a gesture of despair. Itmeant, apparently, that this infidel was too much for him. Then hecalled out a few sharp directions in Arabic. Next minute, our camels'legs were stepping out briskly along the road to Geergeh with apromptitude which I'm sure must have astonished their owners. We rode onand on through the gloom in a fever of suspense. Had any of the Senoosisnoticed our presence? Would they miss the chief's wife before long, andfollow us under arms? Would our own sheikh betray us? I am no coward, aswomen go, but I confess, if it had not been for our fiery Irishman, Ishould have felt my heart sink. We were grateful to him for the recklessand good-humoured courage of the untamed Celt. It kept us from givingway. 'Ye'll take notice, Mr. Sheikh,' he said, as we threaded our wayamong the moon-lit rocks, 'that I have twinty-wan cartridges in me casefor me revolver; and that if there's throuble to-night, 'tis twinty ofthem there'll be for your frinds the Senoosis, and wan for yerself; butfor fear of disappointing a gintleman, 'tis yer own special bullet I'lldisthribute first, if it comes to fighting.'The sheikh's English was a vanishing quantity, but to judge by the wayhe nodded and salaamed at this playful remark, I am convinced heunderstood the Doctor's Irish quite as well as I did.We spoke little by the way; we were all far too frightened, except theDoctor, who kept our hearts up by a running fire of wild Celtic humour.But I found time meanwhile to learn by a few questions from our veiledfriend something of her captivity. She had seen her father massacredbefore her eyes at Khartoum, and had then been sold away to a merchant,who conveyed her by degrees and by various exchanges across the desertthrough lonely spots to the Senoosi oasis. There she had lived all thoseyears with the chief to whom her last purchaser had trafficked her. Shedid not even know that her husband's village was an integral part of theKhedive's territory; far less that the English were now in practicaloccupation of Egypt. She had heard nothing and learnt nothing since thatfateful day; she had waited in vain for the off-chance of a deliverer.'But did you never try to run away to the Nile?' I cried, astonished.'Run away? How could I? I did not even know which way the river lay; andwas it possible for me to cross the desert on foot, or find the chanceof a camel? The Senoosis would have killed me. Even with you to help me,see what dangers surround me; alone, I should have perished, like Hagarin the wilderness, with no angel to save me.''An' ye've got the angel now,' Dr. Macloghlen exclaimed, glancing at me.'Steady, there, Mr. Sheikh. What's this that's coming?'It was another caravan, going the opposite way, on its road to theoasis! A voice halloaed from it.Our new friend clung tight to me. 'My husband!' she whispered, gasping.They were still far off on the desert, and the moon shone bright. A fewhurried words to the Doctor, and with a wild resolve we faced theemergency. He made the camels halt, and all of us, springing off,crouched down behind their shadows in such a way that the coming caravanmust pass on the far side of us. At the same moment the Doctor turnedresolutely to the sheikh. 'Look here, Mr. Arab,' he said in a quietvoice, with one more appeal to the simple Volapuk of the pointedrevolver; 'I cover ye wid this. Let these frinds of yours go by. Ifthere's anny unnecessary talking betwixt ye, or anny throuble of annykind, remimber, the first bullet goes sthraight as an arrow t'rough thathaythen head of yours!'The sheikh salaamed more submissively than ever.The caravan drew abreast of us. We could hear them cry aloud on eitherside the customary salutes: 'In Allah's name, peace!' answered by 'Allahis great; there is no god but Allah.'Would anything more happen? Would our sheikh play us false? It was amoment of breathlessness. We crouched and cowered in the shade, holdingour hearts with fear, while the Arab drivers pretended to be unsaddlingthe camels. A minute or two of anxious suspense; then, peering over ourbeasts' backs, we saw their long line filing off towards the oasis. Wewatched their turbaned heads, silhouetted against the sky, disappearslowly. One by one they faded away. The danger was past. With beatinghearts we rose up again.The Doctor sprang into his place and seated himself on his camel. 'Nowride on, Mr. Sheikh,' he said, 'wid all yer men, as if grim death wasafther ye. Camels or no camels, ye've got to march all night, for ye'llnever draw rein till we're safe back at Geergeh!'And sure enough we never halted, under the persuasive influence of thatloaded revolver, till we dismounted once more in the early dawn upon theNile bank, under British protection.Then Elsie and I and our rescued country-woman broke down together in anorgy of relief. We hugged one another and cried like so many children.VIIITHE ADVENTURE OF THE PEA-GREEN PATRICIANAway to India! A life on the ocean wave once more; and--may it proveless wavy!In plain prose, my arrangement with 'my proprietor,' Mr. Elworthy (thuswe speak in the newspaper trade), included a trip to Bombay for myselfand Elsie. So, as soon as we had drained Upper Egypt journalisticallydry, we returned to Cairo on our road to Suez. I am glad to say, myletters to the _Daily Telephone_ gave satisfaction. My employer wrote,'You are a born journalist.' I confess this surprised me; for I havealways considered myself a truthful person. Still, as he evidently meantit for praise, I took the doubtful compliment in good part, and offeredno remonstrance.I have a mercurial temperament. My spirits rise and fall as if they wereConsols. Monotonous Egypt depressed me, as it depressed the Israelites;but the passage of the Red Sea set me sounding my timbrel. I love freshair; I love the sea, if the sea will but behave itself; and I positivelyrevelled in the change from Egypt.Unfortunately, we had taken our passages by a P. and O. steamer fromSuez to Bombay many weeks beforehand, so as to secure good berths; andstill more unfortunately, in a letter to Lady Georgina, I had chancedto mention the name of our ship and the date of the voyage. I kept up aspasmodic correspondence with Lady Georgina nowadays--tuppence-ha'pennya fortnight; the dear, cantankerous, racy old lady had been thefoundation of my fortunes, and I was genuinely grateful to her; or,rather, I ought to say, she had been their second foundress, for I willdo myself the justice to admit that the first was my own initiative andenterprise. I flatter myself I have the knack of taking the tide on theturn, and I am justly proud of it. But, being a grateful animal, I wroteonce a fortnight to report progress to Lady Georgina. Besides--let mewhisper--strictly between ourselves--'twas an indirect way of hearingabout Harold.This time, however, as events turned out, I recognised that I had made agrave mistake in confiding my movements to my shrewd old lady. She didnot betray me on purpose, of course; but I gathered later that casuallyin conversation she must have mentioned the fact and date of my sailingbefore somebody who ought to have had no concern in it; and thesomebody, I found, had governed himself accordingly. All this, however,I only discovered afterwards. So, without anticipating, I will narratethe facts exactly as they occurred to me.[Illustration: AN ODD-LOOKING YOUNG MAN.]When we mounted the gangway of the _Jumna_ at Suez, and began theprocess of frizzling down the Red Sea, I noted on deck almost at once anodd-looking young man of twenty-two or thereabouts, with a curious faintpea-green complexion. He was the wishy-washiest young man I ever beheldin my life; an achromatic study: in spite of the delicate pea-greeninessof his skin, all the colouring matter of the body seemed somehow to havefaded out of him. Perhaps he had been bleached. As he leant over thetaffrail, gazing down with open mouth and vacant stare at the water, Itook a good long look at him. He interested me much--because he was soexceptionally uninteresting; a pallid, an\\u00e6mic, indefinite hobbledehoy,with a high, narrow forehead, and sketchy features. He had watery,restless eyes of an insipid light blue; thin, yellow hair, almost whitein its paleness; and twitching hands that played nervously all the timewith a shadowy moustache. This shadowy moustache seemed to absorb as arule the best part of his attention; it was so sparse and so blanchedthat he felt it continually--to assure himself, no doubt, of the realityof its existence. I need hardly add that he wore an eye-glass.He was an aristocrat, I felt sure; Eton and Christ Church: no ordinaryperson could have been quite so flavourless. Imbecility like his is onlyto be attained as the result of long and judicious selection.He went on gazing in a vacant way at the water below, an ineffectualpatrician smile playing feebly round the corners of his mouth meanwhile.Then he turned and stared at me as I lay back in my deck-chair. For aminute he looked me over as if I were a horse for sale. When he hadfinished inspecting me, he beckoned to somebody at the far end of thequarter-deck.The somebody sidled up with a deferential air which confirmed my beliefin the pea-green young man's aristocratic origin. It was such deferenceas the British flunkey pays only to blue blood; for he has gradations offlunkeydom. He is respectful to wealth; polite to acquired rank; butservile only to hereditary nobility. Indeed, you can make a rough guessat the social status of the person he addresses by observing which oneof his twenty-seven nicely graduated manners he adopts in addressinghim.The pea-green young man glanced over in my direction, and murmuredsomething to the satellite, whose back was turned towards me. I feltsure, from his attitude, he was asking whether I was the person hesuspected me to be. The satellite nodded assent, whereat the pea-greenyoung man, screwing up his face to fix his eye-glass, stared harder thanever. He must be heir to a peerage, I felt convinced; nobody short ofthat rank would consider himself entitled to stare with such frankunconcern at an unknown lady.Presently it further occurred to me that the satellite's back seemedstrangely familiar. 'I have seen that man somewhere, Elsie,' Iwhispered, putting aside the wisps of hair that blew about my face.'So have I, dear,' Elsie answered, with a slight shudder. And I wasinstinctively aware that I too disliked him.As Elsie spoke, the man turned, and strolled slowly past us, with thatineffable insolence which is the other side of the flunkey'sinsufferable self-abasement. He cast a glance at us as he went by, awithering glance of brazen effrontery. We knew him now, of course: itwas that variable star, our old acquaintance, Mr. Higginson the courier.He was here as himself this time; no longer the count or the mysteriousfaith-healer. The diplomat hid his rays under the garb of theman-servant.'Depend upon it, Elsie,' I cried, clutching her arm with a vague senseof fear, 'this man means mischief. There is danger ahead. When acreature of Higginson's sort, who has risen to be a count and afashionable physician, descends again to be a courier, you may restassured it is because he has something to gain by it. He has some deepscheme afloat. And _we_ are part of it.''His master looks weak enough and silly enough for anything,' Elsieanswered, eyeing the suspected lordling. 'I should think he is just thesort of man such a wily rogue would naturally fasten upon.''When a wily rogue gets hold of a weak fool, who is also dishonest,' Isaid, 'the two together may make a formidable combination. But nevermind. We're forewarned. I think I shall be even with him.'That evening, at dinner in the saloon, the pea-green young man strolledin with a jaunty air and took his seat next to us. The Red Sea, by theway, was kinder than the Mediterranean: it allowed us to dine from thevery first evening. Cards had been laid on the plates to mark ourplaces. I glanced at my neighbour's. It bore the inscription, 'ViscountSouthminster.'That was the name of Lord Kynaston's eldest son--Lady Georgina's nephew;Harold Tillington's cousin! So _this_ was the man who might possiblyinherit Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's money! I remembered now how often andhow fervently Lady Georgina had said, 'Kynaston's sons are all fools.'If the rest came up to sample, I was inclined to agree with her.It also flashed across me that Lord Southminster might have heardthrough Higginson of our meeting with Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst at Florence,and of my acquaintance with Harold Tillington at Schlangenbad andLungern. With a woman's instinct, I jumped at the fact that thepea-green young man had taken passage by this boat, on purpose to baffleboth me and Harold.Thinking it over, it seemed to me, too, that he might have variouspossible points of view on the matter. He might desire, for example,that Harold should marry me, under the impression that his marriage witha penniless outsider would annoy his uncle; for the pea-green young mandoubtless thought that I was still to Mr. Ashurst just that dreadfuladventuress. If so, his obvious cue would be to promote a goodunderstanding between Harold and myself, in order to make us marry, sothat the urbane old gentlemen might then disinherit his favouritenephew, and make a new will in Lord Southminster's interest. Or again,the pea-green young man might, on the contrary, be aware that Mr.Ashurst and I had got on admirably together when we met at Florence; inwhich case his aim would naturally be to find out something that mightset the rich uncle against me. Yet once more, he might merely have heardthat I had drawn up Uncle Marmaduke's will at the office, and he mightdesire to worm the contents of it out of me. Whichever was his design, Iresolved to be upon my guard in every word I said to him, and leave nodoor open to any trickery either way. For of one thing I felt sure, thatthe colourless young man had torn himself away from the mud-honey ofPiccadilly for this voyage to India only because he had heard there wasa chance of meeting me.That was a politic move, whoever planned it--himself or Higginson; for aweek on board ship with a person or persons is the very best chance ofgetting thrown in with them; whether they like it or lump it, they can'teasily avoid you.It was while I was pondering these things in my mind, and resolving withmyself not to give myself away, that the young man with the pea-greenface lounged in and dropped into the next seat to me. He was dressed(amongst other things) in a dinner jacket and a white tie; for myself, Idetest such fopperies on board ship; they seem to me out of place; theyconflict with the infinite possibilities of the situation. One standstoo near the realities of things. Evening dress and _mal-de-mer_ sortill together.[Illustration: HE TURNED TO ME WITH AN INANE SMILE.]As my neighbour sat down, he turned to me with an inane smile whichoccupied all his face. 'Good evening,' he said, in a baronial drawl.'Miss Cayley, I gathah? I asked the skippah's leave to set next yah. Weought to be friends--rathah. I think yah know my poor deah old aunt,Lady Georgina Fawley.'I bowed a somewhat, freezing bow. 'Lady Georgina is one of my dearestfriends,' I answered.'No, really? Poor deah old Georgey! Got somebody to stick up for her atlast, has she? Now that's what I call chivalrous of yah. Magnanimous,isn't it? I like to see people stick up for their friends. And it mustbe a novelty for Georgey. For between you and me, a moah cantankerousspiteful acidulated old cough-drop than the poor deah soul it 'ud bedifficult to hit upon.''Lady Georgina has brains,' I answered; 'and they enable her torecognise a fool when she sees him. I will admit that she does notsuffer fools gladly.'He turned to me with a sudden sharp look in the depths of thelack-lustre eyes. Already it began to strike me that, though thepea-green young man was inane, he had his due proportion of a certaininsidious practical cunning. 'That's true,' he answered, measuring me.'And according to her, almost everybody's a fool--especially herrelations. There's a fine knack of sweeping generalisation about deahskinny old Georgey. The few people she reahlly likes are all archangels;the rest are blithering idiots; there's no middle course with her.'I held my peace frigidly.'She thinks me a very special and peculiah fool,' he went on, crumblinghis bread.'Lady Georgina,' I answered, 'is a person of exceptional discrimination.I would almost always accept her judgment on anyone as practicallyfinal.'He laid down his soup-spoon, fondled the imperceptible moustache withhis tapering fingers, and then broke once more into a cheerful expanseof smile which reminded me of nothing so much as of the village idiot.It spread over his face as the splash from a stone spreads over amill-pond. 'Now that's a nice cheerful sort of thing to say to afellah,' he ejaculated, fixing his eye-glass in his eye, with a fewfierce contortions of his facial muscles. 'That's encouraging, don't yahknow, as the foundation of an acquaintance. Makes a good cornah-stone.Calculated to place things at once upon what yah call a friendly basis.Georgey said you had a pretty wit; I see now why she admiahed it. Birdsof a feathah: very wise old proverb.'I reflected that, after all, this young man had nothing overt againsthim, beyond a fishy blue eye and an inane expression; so, feeling that Ihad perhaps gone a little too far, I continued after a minute, 'And youruncle, how is he?''Marmy?' he inquired, with another elephantine smile; and then Iperceived it was a form of humour with him (or rather, a cheapsubstitute) to speak of his elder relations by their abbreviatedChristian names, without any prefix. 'Marmy's doing very well, thankyah; as well as could be expected. In fact, bettah. Habakkuk on thebrain: it's carrying him off at last. He has Bright's disease verybad--drank port, don't yah know--and won't trouble this wicked worldmuch longah with his presence. It will be a happy release--especiallyfor his nephews.'I was really grieved, for I had grown to like the urbane old gentleman,as I had grown to like the cantankerous old lady. In spite of hisfussiness and his Stock Exchange views on the interpretation ofScripture, his genuine kindliness and his real liking for me hadsoftened my heart to him; and my face must have shown my distress, forthe pea-green young man added quickly with an afterthought: 'But _you_needn't be afraid, yah know. It's all right for Harold Tillington. Youought to know that as well as anyone--and bettah: for it was you whodrew up his will for him at Florence.'I flushed crimson, I believe. Then he knew all about me! 'I was notasking on Mr. Tillington's account,' I answered. 'I asked because I havea personal feeling of friendship for your uncle, Mr. Ashurst.'His hand strayed up to the straggling yellow hairs on his upper lip oncemore, and he smiled again, this time with a curious undercurrent offoolish craftiness. 'That's a good one,' he answered. 'Georgey told meyou were original. Marmy's a millionaire, and many people lovemillionaires for their money. But to love Marmy for himself-- I do callthat originality! Why, weight for age, he's acknowledged to be the mostportentous old boah in London society!''I like Mr. Ashurst because he has a kind heart and some genuineinstincts,' I answered. 'He has not allowed all human feeling to bereplaced by a cheap mask of Pall Mall cynicism.''Oh, I say; how's that for preaching? Don't you manage to give it hot toa fellah, neithah! And at sight, too, without the usual three days ofgrace. Have some of my champagne? I'm a forgiving creachah.''No, thank you. I prefer this hock.''Your friend, then?' And he motioned the steward to pass the bottle.To my great disgust, Elsie held out her glass. I was annoyed at that. Itshowed she had missed the drift of our conversation, and was thereforelacking in feminine intuition. I should be sorry if I had allowed thehigher mathematics to kill out in me the most distinctively womanlyfaculty.From that first day forth, however, in spite of this beginning, LordSouthminster almost persecuted me with his persistent attentions. Hedid all a fellah could possibly do to please me. I could not make outprecisely what he was driving at; but I saw he had some artful game ofhis own to play, and that he was playing it subtly. I also saw that,vapid as he was, his vapidity did not prevent him from being worldlywise with the wisdom of the self-seeking man of the world, who utterlydistrusts and disbelieves in all the higher emotions of humanity. Heharped so often on this string that on our second day out, as we lolledon deck in the heat, I had to rebuke him sharply. He had been sneeringfor some hours. 'There are two kinds of silly simplicity, LordSouthminster,' I said, at last. 'One kind is the silly simplicity of therustic who trusts everybody; the other kind is the silly simplicity ofthe Pall Mall clubman who trusts nobody. It is just as foolish and justas one-sided to overlook the good as to overlook the evil in humanity.If you trust everyone, you are likely to be taken in; but if you trustno one, you put yourself at a serious practical disadvantage, besideslosing half the joy of living.''Then you think me a fool, like Georgey?' he broke out.'I should never be rude enough to say so,' I answered, fanning myself.'Well, you're what I call a first-rate companion for a voyage down theRed Sea,' he put in, gazing abstractedly at the awnings. 'Such a lovelyfreezing mixture! A fellah doesn't need ices when _you're_ on tap. Irecommend you as a refrigeratah.''I am glad,' I answered demurely, 'if I have secured your approbation inthat humble capacity. I'm sure I have tried hard for it.'[Illustration: NOTHING SEEMED TO PUT THE MAN DOWN.]Yet nothing that I could say seemed to put the man down. In spite ofrebuffs, he was assiduous in running down the companion-ladder for myparasol or my smelling-bottle; he fetched me chairs; he stayed me withcushions; he offered to lend me books; he pestered me to drink his wine;and he kept Elsie in champagne, which she annoyed me by accepting. Poordear Elsie clearly failed to understand the creature. 'He's so kind andpolite, Brownie, isn't he?' she would observe in her simple fashion. 'Doyou know, I think he's taken quite a fancy to you! And he'll be an earlby-and-by. I call it romantic. How lovely it would seem, dear, to seeyou a countess.''Elsie,' I said severely, with one hand on her arm, 'you are a dearlittle soul, and I am very fond of you; but if you think I could sellmyself for a coronet to a pasty-faced young man with a pea-greencomplexion and glassy blue eyes--I can only say, my child, you havemisread my character. He isn't a man: he's a lump of putty!'I think Elsie was quite shocked that I should apply these terms to acourtesy lord, the eldest son of a peer. Nature had endowed her with theprofound British belief that peers should be spoken of in choice andpeculiar language. 'If a peer's a fool,' Lady Georgina said once to me,'people think you should say his temperament does not fit him for theconduct of affairs: if he's a rou\\u00e9 or a drunkard, they think you shouldsay he has unfortunate weaknesses.'What most of all convinced me, however, that the wishy-washy young manwith the pea-green complexion must be playing some stealthy game, wasthe demeanour and mental attitude of Mr. Higginson, his courier. Afterthe first day, Higginson appeared to be politeness and deference itselfto us. He behaved to us both, _almost_ as if we belonged to the titledclasses. He treated us with the second best of his twenty-sevengraduated manners. He fetched and carried for us with a courtly gracewhich recalled that distinguished diplomat, the Comte deLaroche-sur-Loiret, at the station at Malines with Lady Georgina. It istrue, at his politest moments, I often caught the undercurrent of awicked twinkle in his eye, and felt sure he was doing it all with someprofound motive. But his external demeanour was everything that onecould desire from a well-trained man-servant; I could hardly believe itwas the same man who had growled to me at Florence, 'I shall be evenwith you yet,' as he left our office.'Do you know, Brownie,' Elsie mused once, 'I really begin to think wemust have misjudged Higginson. He's so extremely polite. Perhaps, afterall, he is really a count, who has been exiled and impoverished for hispolitical opinions.'I smiled and held my tongue. Silence costs nothing. But Mr. Higginson'spolitical opinions, I felt sure, were of that simple communistic sortwhich the law in its blunt way calls fraudulent. They consisted in abelief that all was his which he could lay his hands on.'Higginson's a splendid fellah for his place, yah know, Miss Cayley,'Lord Southminster said to me one evening as we were approaching Aden.'What I like about him is, he's so doosid intelligent.''Extremely so,' I answered. Then the devil entered into me again. 'Hehad the doosid intelligence even to take in Lady Georgina.''Yaas; that's just it, don't you know. Georgey told me that story.Screamingly funny, wasn't it? And I said to myself at once, \\\"Higginson'sthe man for me. I want a courier with jolly lots of brains and noblooming scruples. I'll entice this chap away from Marmy.\\\" And I did. Ioutbid Marmy. Oh, yaas, he's a first-rate fellah, Higginson. What _I_want is a man who will do what he's told, and ask no beastly unpleasantquestions. Higginson's that man. He's as sharp as a ferret.''And as dishonest as they make them.'He opened his hands with a gesture of unconcern. 'All the bettah for mypurpose. See how frank I am, Miss Cayley. I tell the truth. The truth isvery rare. You ought to respect me for it.''It depends somewhat upon the _kind_ of truth,' I answered, with arandom shot. 'I don't respect a man, for instance, for confessing to aforgery.'He winced. Not for months after did I know how a stone thrown at aventure had chanced to hit the spot, and had vastly enhanced his opinionof my cleverness.'You have heard about Dr. Fortescue-Langley too, I suppose?' I went on.'Oh, yaas. Wasn't it real jam? He did the doctor-trick on a lady inSwitzerland. And the way he has come it ovah deah simple old Marmy! Heplayed Marmy with Ezekiel! Not so dusty, was it? He's too lovely foranything!''He's an edged tool,' I said.'Yaas; that's why I use him.''And edged tools may cut the user's fingers.'[Illustration: YAH DON'T CATCH ME GOING SO FAH FROM NEWMARKET.]'Not mine,' he answered, taking out a cigarette. 'Oh deah no. He can'tturn against _me_. He wouldn't dare to. Yah see, I have the fellahentirely in my powah. I know all his little games, and I can expose himany day. But it suits me to keep him. I don't mind telling yah, since Irespect your intellect, that he and I are engaged in pulling off a big_coup_ togethah. If it were not for that, I wouldn't be heah. Yah don'tcatch me going away so fah from Newmarket and the Empire for nothing.''I judged as much,' I answered. And then I was silent.But I wondered to myself why the neutral-tinted young man should be socommunicative to an obviously hostile stranger.For the next few days it amused me to see how hard our lordling tried tosuit his conversation to myself and Elsie. He was absurdly anxious tohumour us. Just at first, it is true, he had discussed the subjects thatlay nearest to his own heart. He was an ardent votary of the noblequadruped; and he loved the turf--whose sward, we judged, he trod mainlyat Tattersall's. He spoke to us with erudition on 'two-year-old form,'and gave us several 'safe things' for the spring handicaps. The Oaks heconsidered 'a moral' for Clorinda. He also retailed certain choiceanecdotes about ladies whose Christian names were chiefly Tottie andFlo, and whose honoured surnames have escaped my memory. Most of themflourished, I recollect, at the Frivolity Music Hall. But when helearned that our interest in the noble quadruped was scarcely more thantepid, and that we had never even visited 'the Friv.,' as heaffectionately called it, he did his best in turn to acquire oursubjects. He had heard us talk about Florence, for example, and hegathered from our talk that we loved its art treasures. So he sethimself to work to be studiously artistic. It was a beautiful study inhuman ineptitude. 'Ah, yaas,' he, murmured, turning up the pale blueeyes ecstatically towards the mast-head. 'Chawming place, Florence! Idote on the pickchahs. I know them all by heart. I assuah yah, I'vespent houahs and houahs feeding my soul in the galleries.''And what particular painter does your soul most feed upon?' I askedbluntly, with a smile.The question staggered him. I could see him hunting through the vacantchambers of his brain for a Florentine painter. Then a faint lightgleamed in the leaden eyes, and he fingered the straw-coloured moustachewith that nervous hand till he almost put a visible point upon it. 'Ah,Raphael?' he said, tentatively, with an inquiring air, yet beaming athis success. 'Don't you think so? Splendid artist, Raphael!''And a very safe guess,' I answered, leading him on. 'You can't go farwrong in mentioning Raphael, can you? But after him?'He dived into the recesses of his memory again, peered about him for aminute or two, and brought back nothing. 'I can't remembah the othahfellahs' names,' he went on; 'they're all so much alike: all in _elli_,don't yah know; but I recollect at the time they impressed me awfully.''No doubt,' I answered.He tried to look through me, and failed. Then he plunged, like a noblesportsman that he was, on a second fetch of memory. 'Ah--and MichaelAngelo,' he went on, quite proud of his treasure-trove. 'Sweet things,Michael Angelo's!''Very sweet,' I admitted. 'So simple; so touching; so tender; sodomestic!'I thought Elsie would explode; but she kept her countenance. Thepea-green young man gazed at me uneasily. He had half an idea by thistime that I was making game of him.However, he fished up a name once more, and clutched at it. 'Savonarola,too,' he adventured. 'I adore Savonarola. His pickchahs are beautiful.''And so rare!' Elsie murmured.'Then there is Fra Diavolo?' I suggested, going one better. 'How do youlike Fra Diavolo?'He seemed to have heard the name before, but still he hesitated.'Ah--what did he paint?' he asked, with growing caution.I stuffed him valiantly. 'Those charming angels, you know,' I answered.'With the roses and the glories!''Oh, yaas; I recollect. All askew, aren't they; like this! I remembahthem very well. But----' a doubt flitted across his brain, 'wasn't hisname Fra Angelico?''His brother,' I replied, casting truth to the winds. 'They workedtogether, you must have heard. One did the saints; the other did theopposite. Division of labour, don't you see; Fra Angelico, Fra Diavolo.'[Illustration: WASN'T FRA DIAVOLO ALSO A COMPOSAH?]He fingered his cigarette with a dubious hand, and wriggled hiseye-glass tighter. 'Yaas, beautiful; beautiful! But----' growingsuspicious apace, 'wasn't Fra Diavolo also a composah?''Of course,' I assented. 'In his off time, he composed. Those earlyItalians--so versatile, you see; so versatile!'He had his doubts, but he suppressed them.'And Torricelli,' I went on, with a side glance at Elsie, who waschoking by this time. 'And Chianti, and Frittura, and Cinquevalli, andGiulio Romano.'His distrust increased. 'Now you're trying to make me commit myself,' hedrawled out. 'I remembah Torricelli--he's the fellah who used to paintall his women crooked. But Chianti's a wine; I've often drunk it; andRomano's--well, every fellah knows Romano's is a restaurant near theGaiety Theatre.''Besides,' I continued, in a drawl like his own, 'there are Risotto, andGnocchi, and Vermicelli, and Anchovy--all famous paintahs, and all ofwhom I don't doubt you admiah.'Elsie exploded at last. But he took no offence. He smiled inanely, as ifhe rather enjoyed it. 'Look heah, you know,' he said, with his craftysmile; 'that's one too much. I'm not taking any. You think yourselvesvery clevah for kidding me with paintahs who are really macaroni andcheese and claret; yet if I were to tell you the Lejah was run at Ascot,or the Cesarewitch at Doncastah, why, you'd be no wisah. When it comesto art, I don't have a look in; but I could tell you a thing or twoabout starting prices.'And I was forced to admit that there he had reason.Still, I think he realised that he had better avoid the subject of artin future, as we avoided the noble quadruped. He saw his limitations.Not till the last evening before we reached Bombay did I reallyunderstand the nature of my neighbour's project. That evening, as itchanced, Elsie had a headache and went below early. I stopped with hertill she dozed off; then I slipped up on deck once more for a breath offresh air, before retiring for the night to the hot and stuffy cabin. Itwas an exquisite evening. The moon rode in the pale green sky of thetropics. A strange light still lingered on the western horizon. Thestifling heat of the Red Sea had given way long since to the refreshingcoolness of the Indian Ocean. I strolled a while on the quarter-deck,and sat down at last near the stern. Next moment, I was aware ofsomebody creeping up to me.'Look heah, Miss Cayley,' a voice broke in; 'I'm in luck at last! I'vebeen waiting, oh, evah so long, for this opportunity.'I turned and faced him. 'Have you, indeed?' I answered. 'Well, I have_not_, Lord Southminster.'I tried to rise, but he motioned me back to my chair. There were ladieson deck, and to avoid being noticed I sank into my seat again.'I want to speak to you,' he went on, in a voice that (for him) wasalmost impressive. 'Half a mo, Miss Cayley. I want to say--this lastnight--you misunderstand me.''On the contrary,' I answered, 'the trouble is--that I understand youperfectly.''No, yah don't. Look heah.' He bent forward quite romantically. 'I'mgoing to be perfectly frank. Of course yah know that when I came onboard this ship I came--to checkmate yah.''Of course,' I replied. 'Why else should you and Higginson have botheredto come here?'He rubbed his hands together. 'That's just it. You're always clevah. Youhit it first shot. But there's wheah the point comes in. At first, Ionly thought of how we could circumvent yah. I treated yah as the enemy.Now, it's all the othah way. Miss Cayley, you're the cleverest woman Ievah met in this world; you extort my admiration.'I could not repress a smile. I didn't know how it was, but I could see Ipossessed some mysterious attraction for the Ashurst family. I was fatalto Ashursts. Lady Georgina, Harold Tillington, the Honourable Marmaduke,Lord Southminster--different types as they were, all succumbed withoutone blow to me.'You flatter me,' I answered, coldly.'No, I don't,' he cried, flashing his cuffs and gazing affectionately athis sleeve-links. ''Pon my soul, I assuah yah, I mean it. I can't tellyou how much I admiah yah. I admiah your intellect. Every day I haveseen yah, I feel it moah and moah. Why, you're the only person who hasevah out-flanked my fellah, Higginson. As a rule I don't think much ofwomen. I've been through several London seasons, and lots of 'em havetried their level best to catch me; the cleverest mammas have been aftahme for their Ethels. But I wasn't so easily caught: I dodged the Ethels.With you, it's different. I feel'--he paused--'you're a woman a fellahmight be really proud of.''You are too kind,' I answered, in my refrigerator voice.'Well, will you take me?' he asked, trying to seize my hand. 'MissCayley, if you will, you will make me unspeakably happy.'It was a great effort--for him--and I was sorry to crush it. 'I regret,'I said, 'that I am compelled to deny you unspeakable happiness.'[Illustration: TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, YOU'RE STAKING YOUR MONEY ON THEWRONG FELLAH.]'Oh, but you don't catch on. You mistake. Let me explain. You're backingthe othah man. Now, I happen to know about that: and I assuah you, it'san error. Take my word for it, you're staking your money on the wrongfellah.''I do not understand you,' I replied, drawing away from his approach.'And what is more, I may add, you could never understand me.''Yaas, but I do. I understand perfectly. I can see where you go wrong.You drew up Marmy's will; and you think Marmy has left all he's worth toHarold Tillington; so you're putting every penny you've got on Harold.Well, that's mere moonshine. Harold may think it's all right; but it'snot all right. There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the Probate Court.Listen heah, Miss Cayley: Higginson and I are a jolly sight sharpah thanyour friend Harold. Harold's what they call a clevah fellah in society,and I'm what they call a fool; but I know bettah than Harold which sideof my bread's buttahed.''I don't doubt it,' I answered.'Well, I have managed this business. I don't mind telling you now, I hada telegram from Marmy's valet when we touched at Aden; and poor oldMarmy's sinking. Habakkuk's been too much for him. Sixteen stone goingunder. Why am I not with him? yah may ask. Because, when a man ofMarmy's temperament is dying, it's safah to be away from him. There'splenty of time for Marmy to altah his will yet--and there are othahcontingencies. Still, Harold's quite out of it. You take my word for it;if you back Harold, you back a man who's not going to get anything;while if you back me, you back the winnah, with a coronet into thebargain.' And he smiled fatuously.I looked at him with a look that would have made a wiser man wince. Butit fell flat on Lord Southminster. 'Do you know why I do not rise and godown to my cabin at once?' I said, slowly. 'Because, if I did, somebodyas I passed might see my burning cheeks--cheeks flushed with shame atyour insulting proposal--and might guess that you had asked me, and thatI had refused you. And I should shrink from the disgrace of anyone'sknowing that you had put such a humiliation upon me. You have been frankwith me--after your kind, Lord Southminster; frank with the frankness ofa low and purely commercial nature. I will be frank with you in turn.You are right in supposing that I love Harold Tillington--a man whosename I hate to mention in your presence. But you are wrong in supposingthat the disposition of Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's money has or can haveanything to do with the feelings I entertain towards him. I would marryhim all the sooner if he were poor and penniless. You cannot_understand_ that state of mind, of course: but you must be content to_accept_ it. And I would not marry _you_ if there were no other man leftin the world to marry. I should as soon think of marrying a lump ofdough.' I faced him all crimson. 'Is _that_ plain enough? Do you see nowthat I really mean it?'He gazed at me with a curious look, and twirled what he considered hismoustache once more, quite airily. The man was imperturbable--apachydermatous imbecile. 'You're all wrong, yah know,' he said, after along pause, during which he had regarded me through his eye-glass as ifI were a specimen of some rare new species. 'You're all wrong, and yahwon't believe me. But I tell yah, I know what I'm talking about. Youthink it's quite safe about Marmy's money--that he's left it to Harold,because you drew the will up. I assuah you that will's not worth thepaper it's written on. You fancy Harold's a hot favourite: he's a rankoutsidah. I give you a chance, and you won't take it. I want yahbecause you're a remarkable woman. Most of the Ethels cry when they'retrying to make a fellah propose to 'em; and I don't like 'em damp: but_you_ have some go about yah. You insist upon backing the wrong man. Butyou'll find your mistake out yet.' A bright idea struck him. 'I say--whydon't you hedge? Leave it open till Marmy's gone, and then marry thewinnah?'It was hopeless trying to make this clod understand. His brain was notbuilt with the right cells for understanding me. 'Lord Southminster,' Isaid, turning upon him and clasping my hands, 'I will not go away whileyou stop here. But you have some spark enough of a gentleman in yourcomposition, I hope, not to inflict your company any longer upon a womanwho does not desire it. I ask you to leave me here alone. When you havegone, and I have had time to recover from your degrading offer, I mayperhaps feel able to go down to my cabin.'He stared at me with open blue eyes--those watery blue eyes. 'Oh, justas you like,' he answered. 'I wanted to do you a good turn, becauseyou're the only woman I evah really admiahed--to say admiah, don't youknow; not trotted round like the Ethels: but you won't allow me. I'll goif you wish it; though I tell you again, you're backing the wrong man,and soonah or latah you'll discover it. I don't mind laying you six tofour against him. Howevah, I'll do one thing for yah: I'll leave thisoffah always open. I'm not likely to marry any othah woman--not goodenough, is it?--and if evah you find out you're mistaken about HaroldTillington, remembah, honour bright, I shall be ready at any time torenew my offah.'By this time I was at boiling-point. I could not find words to answerhim. I waved him away angrily with one hand. He raised his hat withquite a jaunty air and strolled off forward, puffing his cigarette. Idon't think he even knew the disgust with which he inspired me.I sat some hours with the cool air playing about my burning cheeksbefore I mustered up courage to rise and go down below again.IXTHE ADVENTURES OF THE MAGNIFICENT MAHARAJAHOur arrival at Bombay was a triumphal entry. We were received likeroyalty. Indeed, to tell you the truth, Elsie and I were beginning toget just a leetle bit spoiled. It struck us now that our casualconnection with the Ashurst family in its various branches had succeededin saddling us, like the Lady of Burleigh, 'with the burden of an honourunto which we were not born.' We were everywhere treated as persons ofimportance; and, oh dear, by dint of such treatment we began to feel atlast almost as if we had been raised in the purple. I felt that when wegot back to England we should turn up our noses at plain bread andbutter.Yes, life has been kind to me. Have your researches into Englishliterature ever chanced to lead you into reading Horace Walpole, Iwonder? That polite trifler is fond of a word which he coinedhimself--'Serendipity.' It derives from the name of a certain happyIndian Prince Serendip, whom he unearthed (or invented) in some obscureOriental story; a prince for whom the fairies or the genii alwaysmanaged to make everything pleasant. It implies the faculty, which a fewof us possess, of finding whatever we want turn up accidentally at theexact right moment. Well, I believe I must have been born withserendipity in my mouth, in place of the proverbial silver spoon, forwherever I go, all things seem to come out exactly right for me.The _Jumna_, for example, had hardly heaved to in Bombay Harbour when wenoticed on the quay a very distinguished-looking Oriental potentate, ina large, white turban with a particularly big diamond stuckostentatiously in its front. He stalked on board with a martial air, assoon as we stopped, and made inquiries from our captain after someone heexpected. The captain received him with that odd mixture of respect forrank and wealth, combined with true British contempt for the inferiorblack man, which is universal among his class in their dealings withnative Indian nobility. The Oriental potentate, however, who wasaccompanied by a gorgeous suite like that of the Wise Men in Italianpictures, seemed satisfied with his information, and moved over with hisstately glide in our direction. Elsie and I were standing near thegangway among our rugs and bundles, in the hopeless helplessness ofdisembarkation. He approached us respectfully, and, bowing with extendedhands and a deferential air, asked, in excellent English, 'May I ventureto inquire which of you two ladies is Miss Lois Cayley?''_I_ am,' I replied, my breath taken away by this unexpected greeting.'May I venture to inquire in return how you came to know I was arrivingby this steamer?'[Illustration: I AM THE MAHARAJAH OF MOOZUFFERNUGGAR.]He held out his hand, with a courteous inclination. 'I am the Maharajahof Moozuffernuggar,' he answered in an impressive tone, as if everybodyknew of the Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar as familiarly as they knew ofthe Duke of Cambridge. 'Moozuffernuggar in Rajputana--_not_ the one inthe Doab. You must have heard my name from Mr. Harold Tillington.'I had not; but I dissembled, so as to salve his pride. 'Mr. Tillington'sfriends are _our_ friends,' I answered, sententiously.'And Mr. Tillington's friends are _my_ friends,' the Maharajah retorted,with a low bow to Elsie. 'This is no doubt, Miss Petheridge. I haveheard of your expected arrival, as you will guess, from Tillington. Heand I were at Oxford together; I am a Merton man. It was Tillington whofirst taught me all I know of cricket. He took me to stop at hisfather's place in Dumfriesshire. I owe much to his friendship; and whenhe wrote me that friends of his were arriving by the _Jumna_, why, Imade haste to run down to Bombay to greet them.'The episode was one of those topsy-turvy mixtures of all places andages which only this jumbled century of ours has witnessed; it impressedme deeply. Here was this Indian prince, a feudal Rajput chief, livingpractically among his vassals in the Middle Ages when at home in India;yet he said 'I am a Merton man,' as Harold himself might have said it;and he talked about cricket as naturally as Lord Southminster talkedabout the noble quadruped. The oddest part of it all was, we alone feltthe incongruity; to the Maharajah, the change from Moozuffernuggar toOxford and from Oxford back again to Moozuffernuggar seemed perfectlynatural. They were but two alternative phases in a modern Indiangentleman's education and experience.Still, what were we to do with him? If Harold had presented me with awhite elephant I could hardly have been more embarrassed than I was atthe apparition of this urbane and magnificent Hindoo prince. He wasyoung; he was handsome; he was slim, for a rajah; he wore Europeancostume, save for the huge white turban with its obtrusive diamond; andhe spoke English much better than a great many Englishmen. Yet whatplace could he fill in my life and Elsie's? For once, I felt almostangry with Harold. Why couldn't he have allowed us to go quietly throughIndia, two simple unofficial journalistic pilgrims, in our nativeobscurity?His Highness of Moozuffernuggar, however, had his own views on thisquestion. With a courteous wave of one dusky hand, he motioned usgracefully into somebody else's deck chairs, and then sat down onanother beside us, while the gorgeous suite stood by in respectfulsilence--unctuous gentlemen in pink-and-gold brocade--forming a courtall round us. Elsie and I, unaccustomed to be so observed, grewconscious of our hands, our skirts, our postures. But the Maharajahposed himself with perfect unconcern, like one well used to the fiercelight of royalty. 'I have come,' he said, with simple dignity, 'tosuperintend the preparations for your reception.''Gracious heavens!' I exclaimed. 'Our reception, Maharajah? I think youmisunderstand. We are two ordinary English ladies of the proletariat,accustomed to the level plain of professional society. We expect noreception.'He bowed again, with stately Eastern deference. 'Friends ofTillington's,' he said, shortly, 'are persons of distinction. Besides, Ihave heard of you from Lady Georgina Fawley.''Lady Georgina is too good,' I answered, though inwardly I raged againsther. Why couldn't she leave us alone, to feed in peace on dak-bungalowchicken, instead of sending this regal-mannered heathen to bother us?'So I have come down to Bombay to make sure that you are met in thestyle that befits your importance in society,' he went on, waving hissuite away with one careless hand, for he saw it fussed us. 'I mentionedyou to His Honour the Acting-Governor, who had not heard you werecoming. His Honour's aide-de-camp will follow shortly with an invitationto Government House while you remain in Bombay--which will not be manydays, I don't doubt, for there is nothing in this city of plague to stopfor. Later on, during your progress up country, I do myself the honourto hope that you will stay as my guests for as long as you choose atMoozuffernuggar.'My first impulse was to answer: 'Impossible, Maharajah; we couldn'tdream of accepting your kind invitation.' But on second thoughts, Iremembered my duty to my proprietor. Journalism first: inclinationafterwards! My letter from Egypt on the rescue of the Englishwoman whoescaped from Khartoum had brought me great _\\u00e9clat_ as a specialcorrespondent, and the _Daily Telephone_ now billed my name in bigletters on its placards, so Mr. Elworthy wrote me. Here was anothernoble chance; must I not strive to rise to it? Two English ladies at anative court in Rajputana! that ought to afford scope for some rattlingjournalism!'It is extremely kind of you,' I said, hesitating, 'and it would give usgreat pleasure, were it feasible, to accept your friendly offer.But--English ideas, you know, prince! Two unprotected women! I hardlysee how we could come alone to Moozuffernuggar, unchaperoned.'The Maharajah's face lighted up; he was evidently flattered that weshould even thus dubiously entertain his proposal. 'Oh, I've thoughtabout that, too,' he answered, growing more colloquial in tone. 'I'vebeen some days in Bombay, making inquiries and preparations. You see,you had not informed the authorities of your intended visit, so that youwere travelling _incognito_--or should it be _incognita_?--and ifTillington hadn't written to let me know your movements, you might havearrived at this port without anybody's knowing it, and have beencompelled to take refuge in an hotel on landing.' He spoke as if we hadbeen accustomed all our lives long to be received with red cloth by theMayor and Corporation, and presented with illuminated addresses and thefreedom of the city in a gold snuff-box. 'But I have seen to all that.The Acting-Governor's aide-de-camp will be down before long, and I havearranged that if you consent a little later to honour my humble roof inRajputana with your august presence, Major Balmossie and his wife willaccompany you and chaperon you. I have lived in England: of course Iunderstand that two English ladies of your rank and position cannottravel alone--as if you were Americans. But Mrs. Balmossie is a nicelittle soul, of unblemished character'--that sweet touch charmedme--'received at Government House'--he had learned the respect due toMrs. Grundy--'so that if you will accept my invitation, you may restassured that everything will be done with the utmost regard to the--theunaccountable prejudices of Europeans.'His thoughtfulness took me aback. I thanked him warmly. He unbent at mythanks. 'And I am obliged to you in return,' he said. 'It gives me realpleasure to be able, through you, to repay Harold Tillington part of thedebt I owe him. He was so good to me at Oxford. Miss Cayley, you are newto India, and therefore--as yet--no doubt unprejudiced. You treat anative gentleman, I see, like a human being. I hope you will not stoplong enough in our country to get over that stage--as happens to most ofyour countrymen and countrywomen. In England, a man like myself is anIndian prince; in India, to ninety-nine out of a hundred Europeans, heis just \\\"a damned nigger.\\\"'I smiled sympathetically. 'I think,' I said, venturing under thesecircumstances on a harmless little swear-word--of course, in quotationmarks--'you may trust me never to reach \\\"damn-nigger\\\" point.''So I believe,' he answered, 'if you are a friend of HaroldTillington's. Ebony or ivory, he never forgot we were two men together.'[Illustration: WHO'S YOUR BLACK FRIEND?]Five minutes later, when the Maharajah had gone to inquire about ourluggage, Lord Southminster strolled up. 'Oh, I say, Miss Cayley,' heburst out, 'I'm off now; ta-ta: but remembah, that offah's always open.By the way, who's your black friend? I couldn't help laughing at theairs the fellah gave himself. To see a niggah sitting theah, with hissuite all round him, waving his hands and sunning his rings, andbehaving for all the world as if he were a gentleman; it's reahly tooridiculous. Harold Tillington picked up with a fellah like that atOxford--doosid good cricketer too; wondah if this is the same one?''Good-bye, Lord Southminster,' I said, quietly, with a stiff little bow.'Remember, on your side, that your \\\"offer\\\" was rejected once for alllast night. Yes, the Indian prince _is_ Harold Tillington's friend, theMaharajah of Moozuffernuggar--whose ancestors were princes while ourswere dressed in woad and oak-leaves. But you were right about onething; _he_ behaves--like a gentleman.''Oh, I say,' the pea-green young man ejaculated, drawing back; 'that'sanothah in the eye for me. You're a good 'un at facers. You gave me onefor a welcome, and you give me one now for a parting shot. Nevah mindthough, I can wait; you're backing the wrong fellah--but you're not theEthels, and you're well worth waiting for.' He waved his hand. 'So-long!See yah again in London.'And he retired, with that fatuous smile still absorbing his features.       *       *       *       *       *Our three days in Bombay were uneventful; we merely waited to get rid ofthe roll of the ship, which continued to haunt us for hours after welanded--the floor of our bedrooms having acquired an ugly trick ofrising in long undulations, as if Bombay were suffering from chronicearthquake. We made the acquaintance of His Honour the Acting Governor,and His Honour's consort. We were also introduced to Mrs. Balmossie, thelady who was to chaperon us to Moozuffernuggar. Her husband was asoldierly Scotchman from Forfarshire, but she herself was English--aflighty little body with a perpetual giggle. She giggled so much overthe idea of the Maharajah's inviting us to his palace that I wonderedwhy on earth she accepted his invitation. At this she seemed surprised.'Why, it's one of the jolliest places in Rajputana,' she answered, witha bland Simla smile; '_so_ picturesque--he, he, he--and _so_ delightful.Simpkin flows like water-- Simpkin's baboo English for champagne, youknow--he, he, he; and though of course the Maharajah's only a nativelike the rest of them--he, he, he--still, he's been educated at Oxford,and has mixed with Europeans, and he knows how to make one--he, he,he--well, thoroughly comfortable.''But what shall we eat?' I asked. 'Rice, ghee, and chupatties?''Oh dear no--he, he, he--Europe food, every bit of it. Foie gras, andYork ham, and wine _ad lib_. His hospitality's massive. If it weren'tfor that, of course, one wouldn't dream of going there. But Archie hopessome day to be made Resident, don't you know; and it will do him noharm--he, he, he--with the Foreign Office, to have cultivated friendlyrelations beforehand with His Highness of Moozuffernuggar. Thesenatives--he, he, he--so absurdly sensitive!'For myself, the Maharajah interested me, and I rather liked him.Besides, he was Harold's friend, and that was in itself sufficientrecommendation. So I determined to push straight into the heart ofnative India first, and only afterwards to do the regulation touristround of Agra and Delhi, the Taj and the mosques, Benares and Allahabad,leaving the English and Calcutta for the tail-end of my journey. It wasbetter journalism; as I thought that thought, I began to fear that Mr.Elworthy was right after all, and that I was a born journalist.On the day fixed for our leaving Bombay, whom should I meet but LordSouthminster--with the Maharajah--at the railway station!He lounged up to me with that eternal smile still vaguely pervading hisempty features. 'Well, we shall have a jolly party, I gathah,' he said.'They tell me this niggah is famous for his tigahs.'I gazed at him, positively taken aback. 'You don't mean to tell me,' Icried, 'you actually propose to accept the Maharajah's hospitality?'His smile absorbed him. 'Yaas,' he answered twirling his yellowmoustache, and gazing across at the unconscious prince, who was engagedin overlooking the arrangements for our saloon carriage. 'The blackfellah discovahed I was a cousin of Harold's, so he came to call upon meat the club, of which some Johnnies heah made me an honorary membah.He's offahed me the run of his place while I'm in Indiah, and, ofcourse, I've accepted. Eccentric sort of chap; can't make him outmyself: says anyone connected with Harold Tillington is always deah tohim. Rum start, isn't it?''He is a mere Oriental,' I answered, 'unused to the ways of civilisedlife. He cherishes the superannuated virtue of gratitude.''Yaas; no doubt--so I'm coming along with you.'I drew back, horrified. 'Now? While I am there? After what I told youlast week on the steamer?''Oh, that's all right. I bear yah no malice. If I want any fun, ofcourse I must go while _you're_ at Moozuffernuggar.''Why so?''Yah see, this black boundah means to get up some big things at hisplace in your honah; and one naturally goes to stop with anyone who hasbig things to offah. Hang it all, what does it mattah who a fellah is ifhe can give yah good shooting? It's shooting, don't yah know, that keepssociety in England togethah!''And therefore you propose to stop in the same house with me!' Iexclaimed, 'in spite of what I have told you! Well, Lord Southminster, Ishould have thought there were limits which even _your_ taste----'He cut me short with an inane grin. 'There you make your blooming littleerraw,' he answered, airily. 'I told yah, I keep my offah still open;and, hang it all, I don't mean to lose sight of yah in a hurry. Someother fellah might come along and pick you up when I wasn't looking; andI don't want to miss yah. In point of fact, I don't mind telling yah, Iback myself still for a couple of thou' soonah or latah to marry yah.It's dogged as does it; faint heart, they say, nevah won fair lady!'If it had not been that I could not bear to disappoint my Indian prince,I think, when I heard this, I should have turned back then and there atthe station.The journey up country was uneventful, but dusty. The Mofussil appearsto consist mainly of dust; indeed, I can now recall nothing of it butone pervading white cloud, which has blotted from my memory all itsother components. The dust clung to my hair after many washings, and wasnever really beaten out of my travelling clothes; I believe part of itthus went round the world with me to England. When at last we reachedMoozuffernuggar, after two days' and a night's hard travelling, we weremet by a crowd of local grandees, who looked as if they had spent thegreater part of their lives in brushing back their whiskers, and wedrove up at once, in European carriages, to the Maharajah's palace. Thelook of it astonished me. It was a strange and rambling old Hindoohill-fort, high perched on a scarped crag, like Edinburgh Castle, andaccessible only on one side, up a gigantic staircase, guarded on eitherhand by huge sculptured elephants cut in the living sandstone. Belowclustered the town, an intricate mass of tangled alleys. I had neverseen anything so picturesque or so dirty in my life; as for Elsie, shewas divided between admiration for its beauty and terror at thebig-whiskered and white-turbaned attendants.'What sort of rooms shall we have?' I whispered to our moral guarantee,Mrs. Balmossie.'Oh, beautiful, dear,' the little lady smirked back. 'Furnishedthroughout--he, he, he--by Liberty. The Maharajah wants to do honour tohis European guests--he, he, he--he fancies, poor man, he's quiteEuropean. That's what comes of sending these creatures to Oxford! Sohe's had suites of rooms furnished for any white visitors who may chanceto come his way. Ridiculous, isn't it? _And_ champagne--oh, gallons ofit! He's quite proud of his rooms, he, he, he--he's always asking peopleto come and occupy them; he thinks he's done them up in the best styleof decoration.'He had reason, for they were as tasteful as they were dainty andcomfortable. And I could not for the life of me make out why hishospitable inclination should be voted 'ridiculous.' But Mrs. Balmossieappeared to find all natives alike a huge joke together. She never evenspoke of them without a condescending smile of distant compassion.Indeed, most Anglo-Indians seem first to do their best to Anglicise theHindoo, and then to laugh at him for aping the Englishman.After we had been three days at the palace and had spent hours in thewonderful temples and ruins, the Maharajah announced with considerablepride at breakfast one morning that he had got up a tiger-hunt in ourspecial honour.Lord Southminster rubbed his hands.'Ha, that's right, Maharaj,' he said, briskly. 'I do love big game. Totell yah the truth, old man, that's just what I came heah for.''You do me too much honour,' the Hindoo answered, with quiet sarcasm.'My town and palace may have little to offer that is worth yourattention; but I am glad that my big game, at least, has been luckyenough to attract you.'The remark was thrown away on the pea-green young man. He had describedhis host to me as 'a black boundah.' Out of his own mouth I condemnedhim--he supplied the very word--he was himself nothing more than a bornbounder.[Illustration: A TIGER-HUNT IS NOT A THING TO BE GOT UP LIGHTLY.]During the next few days, the preparations for the tiger-hunt occupiedall the Maharajah's energies. 'You know, Miss Cayley,' he said to me, aswe stood upon the big stairs, looking down on the Hindoo city, 'atiger-hunt is not a thing to be got up lightly. Our people themselvesdon't like killing a tiger. They reverence it too much. They're afraidits spirit might haunt them afterwards and bring them bad luck. That'sone of our superstitions.''You do not share it yourself, then?' I asked.He drew himself up and opened his palms, with a twinkling of pendantemeralds. 'I am royal,' he answered, with na\\u00efve dignity, 'and the tigeris a royal beast. Kings know the ways of kings. If a king kills what iskingly, it owes him no grudge for it. But if a common man or a low casteman were to kill a tiger--who can say what might happen?'I saw he was not himself quite free from the superstition.'Our peasants,' he went on, fixing me with his great black eyes, 'won'teven mention the tiger by name, for fear of offending him: they believehim to be the dwelling-place of a powerful spirit. If they wish to speakof him, they say, \\\"the great beast,\\\" or \\\"my lord, the striped one.\\\" Somethink the spirit is immortal except at the hands of a king. But theyhave no objection to see him destroyed by others. They will even pointout his whereabouts, and rejoice over his death; for it relieves thevillage of a serious enemy, and they believe the spirit will only hauntthe huts of those who actually kill him.''Then you know where each tiger lives?' I asked.'As well as your gamekeepers in England know which covert may be drawnfor foxes. Yes; 'tis a royal sport, and we keep it for Maharajahs. Imyself never hunt a tiger till some European visitor of distinctioncomes to Moozuffernuggar, that I may show him good sport. This tiger weshall hunt to-morrow, for example, he is a bad old hand. He has carriedoff the buffaloes of my villagers over yonder for years and years, andof late he has also become a man-eater. He once ate a whole family at ameal--a man, his wife, and his three children. The people at Janwargurhhave been pestering me for weeks to come and shoot him; and each week hehas eaten somebody--a child or a woman; the last was yesterday--but Iwaited till you came, because I thought it would be something to showyou that you would not be likely to see elsewhere.''And you let the poor people go on being eaten, that we might enjoy thissport!' I cried.He shrugged his shoulders, and opened his palms. 'They were villagers,you know--ryots: mere tillers of the soil--poor naked peasants. I havethousands of them to spare. If a tiger eats ten of them, they only say,\\\"It was written upon their foreheads.\\\" One woman more or less--who wouldnotice her at Moozuffernuggar?'Then I perceived that the Maharajah was a gentleman, but still abarbarian.The eventful morning arrived at last, and we started, all agog, for thejungle where the tiger was known to live. Elsie excused herself. Sheremarked to me the night before, as I brushed her back hair for her,that she had 'half a mind' not to go. 'My dear,' I answered, giving thebrush a good dash, 'for a higher mathematician, that phrase lacksaccuracy. If you were to say \\\"seven-eighths of a mind\\\" it would benearer the mark. In point of fact, if you ask my opinion, yourinclination to go is a vanishing quantity.'She admitted the impeachment with an accusing blush. 'You're quiteright, Brownie; to tell you the truth, I'm afraid of it.''So am I, dear; horribly afraid. Between ourselves, I'm in a deadly funkof it. But \\\"the brave man is not he that feels no fear\\\"; and I believethe same principle applies almost equally to the brave woman. I mean\\\"that fear to subdue\\\" as far as I am able. The Maharajah says I shall bethe first girl who has ever gone tiger-hunting. I'm frightened out of mylife. I never held a gun in my born days before. But, Elsie, recollect,this is _splendid_ journalism! I intend to go through with it.''You offer yourself on the altar, Brownie.''I do, dear; I propose to die in the cause. I expect my proprietor tocarve on my tomb, \\\"Sacred to the memory of the martyr of journalism. Shewas killed, in the act of taking shorthand notes, by a Bengal tiger.\\\"'We started at early dawn, a motley mixture. My short bicycling skirt didbeautifully for tiger-hunting. There was a vast company of nativeswells, nawabs and ranas, in gorgeous costumes, whose precise names andtitles I do not pretend to remember; there were also Major Balmossie,Lord Southminster, the Maharajah, and myself--all mounted ongaily-caparisoned elephants. We had likewise, on foot, a miserable crowdof wretched beaters, with dirty white loin-cloths. We were all verybrave, of course--demonstratively brave--and we talked a great deal atthe start about the exhilaration given by 'the spice of danger.' But itsomehow struck me that the poor beaters on foot had the majority of thedanger and extremely little of the exhilaration. Each of us great folkwas mounted on his own elephant, which carried a light basket-workhowdah in two compartments: the front one intended for the noblesportsman, the back one for a servant with extra guns and ammunition. Ipretended to like it, but I fear I trembled visibly. Our mahouts sat onthe elephants' necks, each armed with a pointed goad, to whoseadmonition the huge beasts answered like clock-work. A born journalistalways pretends to know everything before hand, so I speak carelessly ofthe 'mahout,' as if he were a familiar acquaintance. But I don't mindtelling you aside, in confidence, that I had only just learnt the wordthat morning.The Maharajah protested at first against my taking part in the actualhunt, but I think his protest was merely formal. In his heart of heartsI believe he was proud that the first lady tiger-hunter should havejoined his party.Dusty and shadeless, the road from Moozuffernuggar fares straight acrossthe plain towards the crumbling mountains. Behind, in the heat mist, thecastle and palace on their steeply-scarped crag, with the squalid townthat clustered at their feet, reminded me once more most strangely ofEdinburgh, where I used to spend my vacations from Girton. But thepitiless sun differed greatly from the gray haar of the northernmetropolis. It warmed into intense white the little temples of thewayside, and beat on our heads with tropical garishness.I am bound to admit also that tiger-hunting is not quite all it iscracked up to be. In my fancy I had pictured the gallant andbloodthirsty beast rushing out upon us full pelt from some grass-grownnullah at the first sniff of our presence, and fiercely attacking bothmen and elephants. Instead of that, I will confess the whole truth:frightened as at least one of us was of the tiger, the tiger was stillmore desperately frightened of his human assailants. I could see clearlythat, so far from rushing out of his own accord to attack us, his onedesire was to be let alone. He was horribly afraid; he skulked in thejungle like a wary old fox in a trusty spinney. There was no nullah(whatever a nullah may be), there was only a waste of dusty cane-brake.We encircled the tall grass patch where he lurked, forming a big roundwith a ring-fence of elephants. The beaters on foot, advancing, halfnaked, with a caution with which I could fully sympathise, endeavouredby loud shouts and gesticulations to rouse the royal beast to a sense ofhis position. Not a bit of it: the royal beast declined to be drawn; hepreferred retirement. The Maharajah, whose elephant was stationed nextto mine, even apologised for the resolute cowardice with which he clungto his ignoble lurking-place.The beaters drew in: the elephants, raising their trunks in air andsniffing suspicion, moved slowly inward. We had girt him round now witha perfect ring, through which he could not possibly break withoutattacking somebody. The Maharajah kept a fixed eye on my personalsafety. But still the royal animal crouched and skulked, and still theblack beaters shrieked, howled, and gesticulated. At last, among thetall perpendicular lights and shadows of the big grasses and bamboos, Iseemed to see something move--something striped like the stems, yetpassing slowly, slowly, slowly between them. It moved in a stealthyundulating line. No one could believe till he saw it how the brightflame-coloured bands of vivid orange-yellow on the monster's flanks, andthe interspersed black stripes, could fade away and harmonise, in theirnative surroundings, with the lights and shades of the upright jungle.It was a marvel of mimicry. 'Look there!' I cried to the Maharajah,pointing one eager hand. 'What is that thing there, moving?'He stared where I pointed. 'By Jove,' he cried, raising his rifle with asportsman's quickness, 'you have spotted him first! The tiger!'The terrified beast stole slowly and cautiously through the tallgrasses, his lithe, silken side gliding in and out snakewise, and onlyhis fierce eyes burning bright with gleaming flashes between the gloomof the jungle. Once I had seen him, I could follow with ease his sinuouspath among the tangled bamboos, a waving line of beauty in perpetualmotion. The Maharajah followed him too, with his keen eyes, and pointedhis rifle hastily. But, quick as he was, Lord Southminster was beforehim. I had half expected to find the pea-green young man turn coward atthe last moment; but in that I was mistaken: I will do him the justiceto say, whatever else he was, he was a born sportsman. The gleam of joyin his leaden eye when he caught sight of the tiger, the flush ofexcitement on his pasty face, the eagerness of his alert attitude, werethings to see and remember. That moment almost ennobled him. In sight ofdanger, the best instincts of the savage seemed to revive within him. Incivilised life he was a poor creature; face to face with a wild beast hebecame a mighty shikari. Perhaps that was why he was so fond of big-gameshooting. He may have felt it raised him in the scale of being.He lifted his rifle and fired. He was a cool shot, and he wounded thebeast upon its left shoulder. I could see the great crimson stream gushout all at once across the shapely sides, staining the flame-colouredstripes and reddening the black shadows. The tiger drew back, gave alow, fierce growl, and then crouched among the jungle. I saw he wasgoing to leap; he bent his huge backbone into a strong downward curve,took in a deep breath, and stood at bay, glaring at us. Which elephantwould he attack? That was what he was now debating. Next moment, with afrightful R'-r'-r'-r', he had straightened out his muscles, and, like abolt from a bow, had launched his huge bulk forward.I never saw his charge. I never knew he had leapt upon me. I only feltmy elephant rock from side to side like a ship in a storm. He wastrumpeting, shaking, roaring with rage and pain, for the tiger was onhis flanks, its claws buried deep in the skin of his forehead. I couldnot keep my seat; I felt myself tossed about in the frail howdah like apill in a pill-box. The elephant, in a death grapple, was trying toshake off his ghastly enemy. For a minute or two, I was conscious ofnothing save this swinging movement. Then, opening my eyes for a second,I saw the tiger, in all his terrible beauty, clinging to the elephant'shead by the claws of his fore paws, and struggling for a foothold onits trunk with his mighty hind legs, in a wounded agony of despair andvengeance. He would sell his life dear; he would have one or other ofus.Lord Southminster raised his rifle again; but the Maharajah shoutedaloud in an angry voice: 'Don't fire! Don't fire! You will kill thelady! You can't aim at him like that. The beast is rocking so that noone can say where a shot will take effect. Down with your gun, sir,instantly!'[Illustration: IT WENT OFF UNEXPECTEDLY.]My mahout, unable to keep his seat with the rocking, now dropped off hiscushion among the scrub below. He could speak a few words of English.'Shoot, Mem Sahib, shoot!' he cried, flinging his hands up. But I wastossed to and fro, from side to side, with my rifle under my arm. It wasimpossible to aim. Yet in sheer terror I tried to draw the trigger. Ifailed; but somehow I caught my rifle against the side of my cage.Something snapped in it somewhere. It went off unexpectedly, without myaiming or firing. I shut my eyes. When I opened them again, I saw aswimming picture of the great sullen beast, loosing his hold on theelephant. I saw his brindled face; I saw his white tusks. But hisgleaming pupils burned bright no longer. His jaw was full towards me: Ihad shot him between the eyes. He fell, slowly, with blood streamingfrom his nostrils, and his tongue lolling out. His muscles relaxed; hishuge limbs grew limp. In a minute, he lay stretched at full length onthe ground, with his head on one side, a grand, terrible picture.My mahout flung up his hands in wonder and amazement. 'My father!' hecried aloud. 'Truly, the Mem Sahib is a great shikari!'The Maharajah stretched across to me. 'That was a wonderful shot!' heexclaimed. 'I could never have believed a woman could show such nerveand coolness.'Nerve and coolness, indeed! I was trembling all over like an Italiangreyhound, every limb a jelly; and I had not even fired: the rifle wentoff of itself without me. I am innocent of having ever endangered thelife of a haycock. But once more I dissembled. 'Yes, it _was_ adifficult shot,' I said jauntily, as if I rather liked tiger-hunting.'I didn't think I'd hit him.' Still the effect of my speech was somewhatmarred, I fear, by the tears that in spite of me rolled down my cheeksilently.''Pon honah, I nevah saw a finah piece of shooting in my life,' LordSouthminster drawled out. Then he added aside, in an undertone, 'Makes afellow moah determined to annex her than evah!'I sat in my howdah, half dazed. I hardly heard what they were saying. Myheart danced like the elephant. Then it stood still within me. I wasonly aware of a feeling of faintness. Luckily for my reputation as amighty sportswoman, however, I just managed to keep up, and did notactually faint, as I was more than half inclined to do.Next followed the native p\\u00e6an. The beaters crowded round the fallenbeast in a chorus of congratulation. Many of the villagers also ran out,with prayers and ejaculations, to swell our triumph. It was all like adream. They hustled round me and salaamed to me. A woman had shot him!Wonderful! A babel of voices resounded in my ears. I was aware that pureaccident had elevated me into a heroine.'Put the beast on a pad elephant,' the Maharajah called out.The beaters tied ropes round his body and raised him with difficulty.The Maharajah's face grew stern. 'Where are the whiskers?' he asked,fiercely, in his own tongue, which Major Balmossie interpreted for me.The beaters and the villagers, bowing low and expanding their hands,made profuse expressions of ignorance and innocence. But the fact waspatent--the grand face had been mangled. While they had crowded in adense group round the fallen carcass, somebody had cut off the lips andwhiskers and secreted them.'They have ruined the skin!' the Maharajah cried out in angry tones. 'Iintended it for the lady. I shall have them all searched, and the manwho has done this thing----'[Illustration: I SAW HIM NOW THE ORIENTAL DESPOT.]He broke off, and looked around him. His silence was more terrible byfar than the fiercest threat. I saw him now the Oriental despot. All thenatives drew back, awe-struck.'The voice of a king is the voice of a great god,' my mahout murmured,in a solemn whisper. Then nobody else said anything.'Why do they want the whiskers?' I asked, just to set things straightagain. 'They seem to have been in a precious hurry to take them!'The Maharajah's brow cleared. He turned to me once more with hisEuropean manner. 'A tiger's body has wonderful power after his death,'he answered. 'His fangs and his claws are very potent charms. His heartgives courage. Whoever eats of it will never know fear. His liverpreserves against death and pestilence. But the highest virtue of allexists in his whiskers. They are mighty talismans. Chopped up in food,they act as a slow poison, which no doctor can detect, no antidote guardagainst. They are also a sovereign remedy against magic or the evil eye.And administered to women, they make an irresistible philtre, a puissantlove-potion. They secure you the heart of whoever drinks them.''I'd give a couple of monkeys for those whiskahs,' Lord Southminstermurmured, half unnoticed.We began to move again. 'We'll go on to where we know there is anothertiger,' the Maharajah said, lightly, as if tigers were partridges. 'MissCayley, you will come with us?'I rested on my laurels. (I was quivering still from head to foot.) 'No,thank you, Maharajah,' as unconcernedly as I could; 'I've had quiteenough sport for my first day's tiger-hunting. I think I'll go back now,and write a newspaper account of this little adventure.''You have had luck,' he put in. 'Not everyone kills a tiger his firstday out. This will make good reading.''I wouldn't have missed it for a hundred pounds,' I answered.'Then try another.''I wouldn't try another for a thousand,' I cried, fervently. Thatevening, at the palace, I was the heroine of the day. They toasted me ina bumper of Heidsieck's dry monopole. The men made speeches. Everybodytalked gushingly of my splendid courage and my steadiness of hand. Itwas a brilliant shot, under such difficult circumstances. For myself, Isaid nothing. I pretended to look modest. I dared not confess thetruth--that I never fired at all. And from that day to this I have neverconfessed it, till I write it down now in these confiding memoirs.[Illustration: IT'S I WHO AM THE WINNAH.]One episode cast a gloom over my ill-deserved triumph. In the course ofthe evening, a telegram arrived for the pea-green young man by awhite-turbaned messenger. He read it, and crumpled it up carelessly inhis hand. I looked inquiry. 'Yaas,' he answered, nodding. 'You're quiteright. It's that! Pooah old Marmy has gone, aftah all! Ezekiel andHabakkuk have carried off his sixteen stone at last! And I don't mindtelling yah now--though it was a neah thing--it's _I_ who am thewinnah!'XTHE ADVENTURE OF THE CROSS-EYED Q.C.The 'cold weather,' as it is humorously called, was now drawing to aclose, and the young ladies in sailor hats and cambric blouses, whoflock to India each autumn for the annual marriage-market, werebeginning to resign themselves to a return to England--unless, ofcourse, they had succeeded in 'catching.' So I realised that I musthurry on to Delhi and Agra, if I was not to be intercepted by theintolerable summer.When we started from Moozuffernuggar for Delhi and the East, LordSouthminster was starting for Bombay and Europe. This surprised me not alittle, for he had confided to my unsympathetic ear a few nightsearlier, in the Maharajah's billiard-room, that he was 'stony broke,'and must wait at Moozuffernuggar for lack of funds 'till the oof-birdlaid' at his banker's in England. His conversation enlarged myvocabulary, at any rate.'So you've managed to get away?' I exclaimed, as he dawdled up to me atthe hot and dusty station.'Yaas,' he drawled, fixing his eye-glass, and lighting a cigarette.'I've--p'f--managed to get away. Maharaj seems to have thought--p'f--itwould be cheepah in the end to pay me out than to keep me.''You don't mean to say he offered to lend you money?' I cried.'No; not exactly that: _I_ offahed to borrow it.''From the man you call a nigger?'His smile spread broader over his face than ever. 'Well, we borrow fromthe Jews, yah know,' he said pleasantly, 'so why the jooce shouldn't weborrow from the heathen also? Spoiling the Egyptians, don't yahsee?--the same as we used to read about in the Scripchah when we wereinnocent kiddies. Like marriage, quite. You borrow in haste--and repayat leisure.'He strolled off and took his seat. I was glad to get rid of him at themain line junction.In accordance with my usual merciful custom, I spare you the details ofour visit to Agra, Muttra, Benares. At Calcutta, Elsie left me. Herhealth was now quite restored, dear little soul-- I felt I had done thatone good thing in life if no other--and she could no longer withstandthe higher mathematics, which were beckoning her to London withinvisible fingers. For myself, having so far accomplished my originaldesign of going round the world with twopence in my pocket, I could notbear to draw back at half the circuit; and Mr. Elworthy having willinglyconsented to my return by Singapore and Yokohama, I set out alone on myhomeward journey.[Illustration: HE WROTE, I EXPECT YOU TO COME BACK TO ENGLAND AND MARRYME.]Harold wrote me from London that all was going well. He had found thewill which I drew up at Florence in his uncle's escritoire, andeverything was left to him; but he trusted, in spite of this untowardcircumstance, long absence might have altered my determination. 'DearLois,' he wrote, 'I _expect_ you to come back to England and marry me!'I was brief, but categorical. Nothing, meanwhile, had altered myresolve. I did not wish to be considered mercenary. While he was richand honoured, I could never take him. If, some day, fortunefrowned--but, there--let us not forestall the feet of calamity: let usawait contingencies.Still, I was heavy in heart. If only it had been otherwise! To say thetruth, I should be thrown away on a millionaire; but just think what asplendid managing wife a girl like me would have made for a pennilesspauper!At Yokohama, however, while I dawdled in curiosity shops, a telegramfrom Harold startled me into seriousness. My chance at last! I knew whatit meant; that villain Higginson!'Come home at once. I want your evidence to clear my character.Southminster opposes the will as a forgery. He has a strong case; theexperts are with him.'Forgery! That was clever. I never thought of that. I suspected them oftrying to forge a will of their own; but to upset the real one--to throwthe burden of suspicion on Harold's shoulders--how much subtler andcraftier!I saw at a glance it gave them every advantage. In the first place, itput Harold virtually in the place of the accused, and compelled him todefend instead of attacking--an attitude which prejudices people againstone from the outset. Then, again, it implied positive criminality on hispart, and so allowed Lord Southminster to assume the air of injuredinnocence. The eldest son of the eldest brother, unjustly set aside bythe scheming machinations of an unscrupulous cousin! Primogeniture, theingrained English love for keeping up the dignity of a noble family, theprejudice in favour of the direct male line as against the female--allwere astutely utilised in Lord Southminster's interest. But worst ofall, it was _I_ who had typewritten the will--I, a friend of Harold's, awoman whom Lord Southminster would doubtless try to exhibit as his_fianc\\u00e9e_. I saw at once how much like conspiracy it looked: Harold andI had agreed together to concoct a false document, and Harold had forgedhis uncle's signature to it. Could a British jury doubt when a Lorddeclared it?Fortunately, I was just in time to catch the Canadian steamer from Japanto Vancouver. But, oh, the endless breadth of that broad Pacific! Howtime seemed to lag, as each day one rose in the morning, in the midst ofspace; blue sky overhead; behind one, the hard horizon; in front of one,the hard horizon; and nothing else visible: then steamed on all day, toarrive at night, where?--why, in the midst of space; starry skyoverhead; behind one, the dim horizon; in front of one, the dim horizon;and nothing else visible. The Nile was child's play to it.[Illustration: IT WAS ENDLESSLY WEARISOME.]Day after day we steamed, and night after night were still where webegan--in the centre of the sea, no farther from our starting-point, nonearer to our goal, yet for ever steaming. It was endlessly wearisome;who could say what might be happening meanwhile in England?At last, after months, as it seemed, of this slow torture, we reachedVancouver. There, in the raw new town, a telegram awaited me. 'Glad tohear you are coming. Make all haste. You may be just in time to arrivefor the trial.'Just in time! I would not waste a moment. I caught the first train onthe Canadian Pacific, and travelled straight through, day and night, toMontreal and Quebec, without one hour's interval.I cannot describe to you that journey across a continent I had neverbefore seen. It was endless and hopeless. I only know that we crawled upthe Rocky Mountains and the Selkirk Range, over spider-like viaducts,with interminable effort, and that the prairies were just the broadPacific over again. They rolled on for ever. But we did reach Quebec--intime we reached it; and we caught by an hour the first liner toLiverpool.At Prince's Landing-stage another telegram awaited me. 'Come onat once. Case now proceeding. Harold is in court. We need yourevidence.--GEORGINA FAWLEY.'I might still be in time to vindicate Harold's character.At Euston, to my surprise, I was met not only by my dear cantankerousold lady, but also by my friend, the magnificent Maharajah, dressed thistime in a frock-coat and silk hat of Bond Street glossiness.'What has brought you to England?' I asked, astonished. 'The Jubilee?'He smiled, and showed his two fine rows of white teeth. 'That,nominally. In reality, the cricket season (I play for Berks). But mostof all, to see dear Tillington safe through this trouble.''He's a brick!' Lady Georgina cried with enthusiasm. 'A regular brick,my dear Lois! His carriage is waiting outside to take you up to myhouse. He has stood by Harold--well, like a Christian!''Or a Hindu,' the Maharajah corrected, smiling.'And how have you been all this time, dear Lady Georgina?' I asked,hardly daring to inquire about what was nearest to my soul--Harold.The cantankerous old lady knitted her brows in a familiar fashion. 'Oh,my dear, don't ask: I haven't known a happy hour since you left me inSwitzerland. Lois, I shall never be happy again without you! It wouldpay me to give you a retaining fee of a thousand a year--honour bright,it would, I assure you. What I've suffered from the Gretchens sinceyou've been in the East has only been equalled by what I've sufferedfrom the Mary Annes and the C\\u00e9lestines. Not a hair left on my scalp; notone hair, I declare to you. They've made my head into a _tabula rasa_for the various restorers. George R. Sims and Mrs. S. A. Allen are goingto fight it out between them. My dear, I wish _you_ could take my maid'splace; I've always said----'I finished the speech for her. 'A lady can do better whatever she turnsher hand to than any of these hussies.'She nodded. 'And why? Because her hands _are_ hands; while as for theGretchens and the Mary Annes, \\\"paws\\\" is the only word one can honestlyapply to them. Then, on top of it all comes this trouble about Harold.So distressing, isn't it? You see, at the point which the matter hasreached, it's simply impossible to save Harold's reputation withoutwrecking Southminster's. Pretty position that for a respectable family!The Ashursts hitherto have been _quite_ respectable: a co-respondent ortwo, perhaps, but never anything serious. Now, either Southminster sendsHarold to prison, or Harold sends Southminster. There's a nice sort ofdilemma! I always knew Kynaston's boys were born fools; but to findthey're born knaves, too, is hard on an old woman in her hairlessdotage. However, _you've_ come, my child, and _you'll_ soon set thingsright. You're the one person on earth I can trust in this matter.'Harold go to prison! My head reeled at the thought. I staggered out intothe open air, and took my seat mechanically in the Maharajah's carriage.All London swam before me. After so many months' absence, thepolychromatic decorations of our English streets, looming up through thesmoke, seemed both strange and familiar. I drove through the first halfmile with a vague consciousness that Lipton's tea is the perfection ofcocoa and matchless for the complexion, but that it dyes all colours,and won't wash clothes.After a while, however, I woke up to the full terror of the situation.'Where are you taking me?' I inquired.'To my house, dear,' Lady Georgina answered, looking anxiously at me;for my face was bloodless.'No, that won't do,' I answered. 'My cue must be now to keep myself asaloof as possible from Harold and Harold's backers. I must put up at anhotel. It will sound so much better in cross-examination.''She's quite right,' the Maharajah broke in, with sudden conviction.'One must block every ball with these nasty swift bowlers.''Where's Harold?' I asked, after another pause. 'Why didn't he come tomeet me?''My dear, how could he? He's under examination. A cross-eyed Q.C. withan odious leer. Southminster's chosen the biggest bully at the Bar tosupport his contention.''Drive to some hotel in the Jermyn Street district,' I cried to theMaharajah's coachman. 'That will be handy for the law courts.'He touched his hat and turned. In a sort of dickey behind sat twogorgeous-turbaned Rajput servants.That evening Harold came round to visit me at my rooms. I could see hewas much agitated. Things had gone very badly. Lady Georgina was there;she had stopped to dine with me, dear old thing, lest I should feellonely and give way; so had Elsie Petheridge. Mr. Elworthy sent atelegram of welcome from Devonshire. I knew at least that my friendswere rallying round me in this hour of trial. The kind Maharajah himselfwould have come too, if I had allowed him, but I thought it inexpedient.They explained everything to me. Harold had propounded Mr. Ashurst'swill--the one I drew up at Florence--and had asked for probate. LordSouthminster intervened and opposed the grant of probate on the groundthat the signatures were forgeries. He propounded instead another will,drawn some twenty years earlier, when they were both children, dulyexecuted at the time, and undoubtedly genuine; in it, testator lefteverything without reserve to the eldest son of his eldest brother, LordKynaston.'Marmy didn't know in those days that Kynaston's sons would all grow upfools,' Lady Georgina said tartly. 'Besides which, that was before thepoor dear soul took to plunging on the Stock Exchange and made hismoney. He had nothing to leave then but his best silk hat and a fewpaltry hundreds. Afterwards, when he'd feathered his nest in soap andcocoa, he discovered that Bertie--that's Lord Southminster--was afirst-class idiot. Marmy never liked Southminster, nor SouthminsterMarmy. For after all, with all his faults, Marmy _was_ a gentleman;while Bertie--well, my dear, we needn't put a name to it. So he alteredhis will, as you know, when he saw the sort of man Southminster turnedout, and left practically everything he possessed to Harold.''Who are the witnesses to the will?' I asked.'There's the trouble. Who do you think? Why, Higginson's sister, who wasMarmy's _masseuse_, and a waiter--Franz Markheim--at the hotel atFlorence, who's dead they say--or, at least, not forthcoming.''And Higginson's sister forswears her signature,' Harold added gloomily;'while the experts are, most of them, dead against the genuineness of myuncle's.''That's clever,' I said, leaning back, and taking it in slowly.'Higginson's sister! How well they've worked it. They couldn't preventMr. Ashurst from making this will, but they managed to supply their owntainted witnesses! If it had been Higginson himself now, he'd have hadto be cross-examined; and in cross-examination, of course, we could haveshaken his credit, by bringing up the episodes of the Count deLaroche-sur-Loiret and Dr. Fortescue-Langley. But his sister! What's shelike? Have you anything against her?''My dear,' Lady Georgina cried, 'there the rogue has bested us. Isn't itjust like him? What do you suppose he has done? Why, provided himselfwith a sister of tried respectability and blameless character.''And she denies that it is her handwriting?' I asked.'Declares on her Bible oath she never signed the document.'I was fairly puzzled. It was a stupendously clever dodge. Higginson musthave trained up his sister for forty years in the ways of wickedness,yet held her in reserve for this supreme moment.'And where is Higginson?' I asked.Lady Georgina broke into a hysterical laugh. 'Where is he, my dear?That's the question. With consummate strategy, the wretch hasdisappeared into space at the last moment.''That's artful again,' I said. 'His presence could only damage theircase. I can see, of course, Lord Southminster has no need of him.''Southminster's the wiliest fool that ever lived,' Harold broke outbitterly. 'Under that mask of imbecility, he's a fox for trickiness.'I bit my lip. 'Well, if you succeed in evading him,' I said, 'you willhave cleared your character. And if you don't--then, Harold, our timewill have come: you will have your longed-for chance of trying me.''That won't do me much good,' he answered, 'if I have to wait fourteenyears for you--at Portland.'[Illustration: THE CROSS-EYED Q.C. BEGGED HIM TO BE VERY CAREFUL.]Next morning, in court, I heard Harold's cross-examination. He describedexactly where he had found the contested will in his uncle's escritoire.The cross-eyed Q.C., a heavy man with bloated features and a bulbousnose, begged him, with one fat uplifted forefinger, to be very careful.How did he know where to look for it?'Because I knew the house well: I knew where my uncle was likely to keephis valuables.''Oh, indeed; _not_ because you had put it there?'The court rang with laughter. My face grew crimson.After an hour or two of fencing, Harold was dismissed. He stood down,baffled. Counsel recalled Lord Southminster.The pea-green young man, stepping briskly up, gazed about him,open-mouthed, with a vacant stare. The look of cunning on his face wascarefully suppressed. He wore, on the contrary, an air of injuredinnocence combined with an eye-glass.'_You_ did not put this will in the drawer where Mr. Tillington foundit, did you?' counsel asked.The pea-green young man laughed. 'No, I certainly didn't put it theah.My cousin Harold was man in possession. He took jolly good care _I_didn't come neah the premises.''Do you think you could forge a will if you tried?'Lord Southminster laughed. 'No, I don't,' he answered, with awell-assumed _na\\u00efvet\\u00e9_. 'That's just the difference between us, don'tyah know. _I'm_ what they call a fool, and my cousin Harold's a preciousclevah fellah.'There was another loud laugh.'That's not evidence,' the judge observed, severely.It was not. But it told far more than much that was. It told stronglyagainst Harold.'Besides,' Lord Southminster continued, with engaging frankness, 'if Iforged a will at all, I'd take jolly good care to forge it in my ownfavah.'My turn came next. Our counsel handed me the incriminated will. 'Did youdraw up this document?' he asked.I looked at it closely. The paper bore our Florentine water-mark, andwas written with a Spread-Eagle. 'I type-wrote it,' I answered, gazingat it with care to make sure I recognised it.Our counsel's business was to uphold the will, not to cast aspersionsupon it. He was evidently annoyed at my close examination. 'You have nodoubts about it?' he said, trying to prompt me.I hesitated. 'No, no doubts,' I answered, turning over the sheet andinspecting it still closer. 'I type-wrote it at Florence.''Do you recognise that signature as Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's?' he wenton.I stared at it. Was it his? It was like it, certainly. Yet that _k_? andthose _s_'s? I almost wondered.Counsel was obviously annoyed at my hesitation. He thought I was playinginto the enemy's hands. 'Is it his, or is it not?' he inquired again,testily.'It is his,' I answered. Yet I own I was troubled.[Illustration: I WAS A GROTESQUE FAILURE.]He asked many questions about the circumstances of the interview when Itook down the will. I answered them all. But I vaguely felt he and Iwere at cross-purposes. I grew almost as uncomfortable under his gaze asif he had been examining me in the interest of the other side. Hemanaged to fluster me. As a witness for Harold, I was a grotesquefailure.Then the cross-eyed Q.C., rising and shaking his huge bulk, began tocross-examine me. 'Where did you type-write this thing, do you say?' hesaid, pointing to it contemptuously.'In my office at Florence.''Yes, I understand; you had an office in Florence--after you gave upretailing bicycles on the public roads; and you had a partner, Ithink--a Miss Petherick, or Petherton, or Pennyfarthing, or something?''Miss Petheridge,' I corrected, while the Court tittered.'Ah, Petheridge, you call it! Well, now answer this question carefully.Did your Miss Petheridge hear Mr. Ashurst dictate the terms of his lastwill and testament?''No,' I answered. 'The interview was of a strictly confidentialcharacter. Mr. Ashurst took me aside into the back room at our office.''Oh, he took you aside? Confidential? Well, now we're getting at it. Anddid anybody but yourself see or hear any part whatsoever of thisprecious document?''Certainly not,' I replied. 'It was a private matter.''Private! oh, very! Nobody else saw it. Did Mr. Ashurst take it awayfrom the office in person?''No; he sent his courier for it.''His courier? The man Higginson?''Yes; but I refused to give it to Higginson. I took it myself that nightto the hotel where Mr. Ashurst was stopping.''Ah! You took it yourself. So the only other person who knows anythingat first hand about the existence of the alleged will is this personHigginson?''Miss Petheridge knows,' I said, flushing. 'At the time, I told her ofit.''Oh, _you_ told her. Well, that doesn't help us much. If what you areswearing isn't true--remember, you are on your oath--what you told MissPetherick or Petheridge or Pennyfarthing, \\\"at the time,\\\" can hardly beregarded as corroborative evidence. Your word then and your word now arejust equally valuable--or equally worthless. The only person who knowsbesides yourself is Higginson. Now, I ask you, _where_ is Higginson?_Are_ you going to produce him?'The wicked cunning of it struck me dumb. They were keeping him away, andthen using his absence to cast doubts on my veracity. 'Stop,' I cried,taken aback, 'Higginson is well known to be a rogue, and he is keepingaway lest he may damage your side. I know nothing of Higginson.''Yes, I'm coming to that in good time. Don't be afraid that we're goingto pass over Higginson. You admit this man is a man of bad character.Now, what do you know of him?'I told the stories of the Count and of Dr. Fortescue-Langley.The cross-eyed cross-examiner leant across towards me and leered. 'Andthis is the man,' he exclaimed, with a triumphant air, 'whose sister youpretended you had got to sign this precious document of yours?''Whom Mr. Ashurst got to sign it,' I answered, red-hot. 'It is not _my_document.''And you have heard that she swears it is not her signature at all?''So they tell me. She is Higginson's sister. For all I know, she may beprepared to swear, or to forswear, anything.''Don't cast doubt upon our witnesses without cause! Miss Higginson is aneminently respectable woman. You gave this document to Mr. Ashurst, yousay. There your knowledge of it ends. A signature is placed on it whichis not his, as our experts testify. It purports to be witnessed by aSwiss waiter, who is not forthcoming, and who is asserted to be dead, aswell as by a nurse who denies her signature. And the only other personwho knows of its existence before Mr. Tillington \\\"discovers\\\" it in hisuncle's desk is--the missing man Higginson. Is that, or is it not, thetruth of the matter?''I suppose so,' I said, baffled.'Well, now, as to this man Higginson. He first appears upon the scene,so far as you are concerned, on the day when you travelled from Londonto Schlangenbad?''That is so,' I answered.'And he nearly succeeded then in stealing Lady Georgina Fawley'sjewel-case?''He nearly took it, but I saved it.' And I explained the circumstance.The cross-eyed Q.C. held his fat sides with his hands, lookingincredulously at me, and smiled. His vast width of waistcoat shook withsilent merriment. 'You are a very clever young lady,' he murmured. 'Youcan explain away anything. But don't you think it just as likely that itwas a plot between you two, and that owing to some mistake the plot cameoff unsuccessful?''I do not,' I cried, crimson. 'I never saw the Count before thatmorning.'He tried another tack. 'Still, wherever you went, this manHigginson--the only other person, you admit, who knows about theprevious existence of the will--turned up simultaneously. He was alwaysturning up--at the same place as you did. He turned up at Lucerne, as afaith-healer, didn't he?''If you will allow me to explain,' I cried, biting my lip.He bowed, all blandness. 'Oh, certainly,' he murmured. 'Explain awayeverything!'I explained, but of course he had discounted and damaged my explanation.He made no comment. 'And then,' he went on, with his hands on his hips,and his obtrusive rotundity, 'he turned up at Florence, as courier toMr. Ashurst, at the very date when this so-called will was beingconcocted?''He was at Florence when Mr. Ashurst dictated it to me,' I answered,growing desperate.'You admit he was in Florence. Good! Once more he turned up in Indiawith my client, Lord Southminster, upon whose youth and inexperience hehad managed to impose himself. And he carried him off, did he not, byone of these strange coincidences to which _you_ are peculiarly liable,on the very same steamer on which _you_ happened to be travelling?''Lord Southminster told me he took Higginson with him because a roguesuited his book,' I answered, warmly.'Will you swear his lordship didn't say \\\"_the_ rogue suited hisbook\\\"--which is quite another thing?' the Q.C. asked blandly.'I will swear he did not,' I replied. 'I have correctly reported him.''Then I congratulate you, young lady, on your excellent memory. My lud,will you allow me later to recall Lord Southminster to testify on thispoint?'The judge nodded.'Now, once more, as to your relations with the various members of theAshurst family. You introduced yourself to Lady Georgina Fawley, Ibelieve, quite casually, on a seat in Kensington Gardens?''That is true,' I answered.'You had never seen her before?''Never.''And you promptly offered to go with her as her lady's maid toSchlangenbad in Germany?''In place of her lady's maid, for one week,' I answered.'Ah; a delicate distinction! \\\"In place of her lady's maid.\\\" You are alady, I believe; an officer's daughter, you told us; educated atGirton?''So I have said already,' I replied, crimson.'And you stick to it? By all means. Tell--the truth--and stick to it.It's always safest. Now, don't you think it was rather an odd thing foran officer's daughter to do--to run about Germany as maid to a lady oftitle?'[Illustration: THE JURY SMILED.]I tried to explain once more; but the jury smiled. You can't justifyoriginality to a British jury. Why, they would send you to prison atonce for that alone, if they made the laws as well as dispensing them.He passed on after a while to another topic. 'I think you have boastedmore than once in society that when you first met Lady Georgina Fawleyyou had twopence in your pocket to go round the world with?''I had,' I answered--'and I went round the world with it.''Exactly. I'm getting there in time. With it--and other things. A fewmonths later, more or less, you were touring up the Nile in your steamdahabeeah, and in the lap of luxury; you were taking saloon-carriages onIndian railways, weren't you?'I explained again. 'The dahabeeah was in the service of the _DailyTelephone_,' I answered. 'I became a journalist.'He cross-questioned me about that. 'Then I am to understand,' he said atlast, leaning forward with all his waistcoat, 'that you sprang yourselfupon Mr. Elworthy at sight, pretty much as you sprang yourself upon LadyGeorgina Fawley?''We arranged matters quickly,' I admitted. The dexterous wretch wasmaking my strongest points all tell against me.'H'm! Well, he was a man: and you will admit, I suppose,' fingering hissmooth fat chin, 'that you are a lady of--what is the stock phrase thereporters use?--considerable personal attractions?''My Lord,' I said, turning to the Bench, 'I appeal to you. Has he theright to compel me to answer that question?'[Illustration: THE QUESTION REQUIRES NO ANSWER, HE SAID.]The judge bowed slightly. 'The question requires no answer,' he said,with a quiet emphasis. I burned bright scarlet.'Well, my lud, I defer to your ruling,' the cross-eyed cross-examinercontinued, radiant. 'I go on to another point. When in India, Ibelieve, you stopped for some time as a guest in the house of a nativeMaharajah.''Is that matter relevant?' the judge asked, sharply.'My lud,' the Q.C. said, in his blandest voice, 'I am striving tosuggest to the jury that this lady--the only person who ever beheld thisso-called will till Mr. Harold Tillington--described in its terms as\\\"Younger of Gledcliffe,\\\" whatever that may be--produced it out of hisuncle's desk-- I am striving to suggest that this lady is--my duty to myclient compels me to say--an adventuress.'He had uttered the word. I felt my character had not a leg left to standupon before a British jury.'I went there with my friend, Miss Petheridge----' I began.'Oh, Miss Petheridge once more--you hunt in couples?''Accompanied and chaperoned by a married lady, the wife of a MajorBalmossie, on the Bombay Staff Corps.''That was certainly prudent. One ought to be chaperoned. Can you producethe lady?''How is it possible?' I cried. 'Mrs. Balmossie is in India.''Yes; but the Maharajah, I understand, is in London?''That is true,' I answered.'And he came to meet you on your arrival yesterday.''With Lady Georgina Fawley,' I cried, taken off my guard.'Do you not consider it curious,' he asked, 'that these Higginsons andthese Maharajahs should happen to follow you so closely round theworld?--should happen to turn up wherever you do?''He came to be present at this trial,' I exclaimed.'And so did you. I believe he met you at Euston last night, and droveyou to your hotel in his private carriage.''With Lady Georgina Fawley,' I answered, once more.'And Lady Georgina is on Mr. Tillington's side, I fancy? Ah, yes, Ithought so. And Mr. Tillington also called to see you; and likewise MissPetherick-- I beg your pardon, Petheridge. We must be strictlyaccurate--where Miss Petheridge is concerned. And, in fact, you hadquite a little family party.''My friends were glad to see me back again,' I murmured.He sprang a fresh innuendo. 'But Mr. Tillington did not resent yourvisit to this gallant Maharajah?''Certainly not,' I cried, bridling. 'Why should he?''Oh, we're getting to that too. Now answer me this carefully. We want tofind out what interest you might have, supposing a will were forged, oneither side, in arranging its terms. We want to find out just who wouldbenefit by it. Please reply to this question, yes or no, withoutprevarication. Are you or are you not conditionally engaged to Mr.Harold Tillington?''If I might explain----' I began, quivering.He sneered. 'You have a genius for explaining, we are aware. Answer mefirst, yes or no; we will qualify afterward.'I glanced appealingly at the judge. He was adamant. 'Answer as counseldirects you, witness,' he said, sternly.'Yes, I am,' I faltered. 'But----''Excuse me one moment. You promised to marry him conditionally upon theresult of Mr. Ashurst's testamentary dispositions?''I did,' I answered; 'but----'My explanation was drowned in roars of laughter, in which the judgejoined, in spite of himself. When the mirth in court had subsided alittle, I went on: 'I told Mr. Tillington I would only marry him in casehe was poor and without expectations. If he inherited Mr. MarmadukeAshurst's money, I could never be his wife,' I said it proudly.The cross-eyed Q.C. drew himself up and let his rotundity take care ofitself. 'Do you take me,' he inquired, 'for one of Her Majesty'shorse-marines?'There was another roar of laughter--feebly suppressed by a judicialfrown--and I slank away, annihilated.'You can go,' my persecutor said. 'I think we have got--well, everythingwe wanted from you. You promised to marry him, if all went ill! That isa delicate feminine way of putting it. Women like these equivocations.They relieve one from the onus of speaking frankly.'I stood down from the box, feeling, for the first time in my life,conscious of having scored an ignominious failure.Our counsel did not care to re-examine me; I recognised that it would beuseless. The hateful Q.C. had put all my history in such an odious lightthat explanation could only make matters worse--it must savour ofapology. The jury could never understand my point of view. It couldnever be made to see that there are adventuresses and adventuresses.Then came the final speeches on either side. Harold's advocate said thebest he could in favour of the will our party propounded; but his bestwas bad; and what galled me most was this-- I could see he himself didnot believe in its genuineness. His speech amounted to little more thana perfunctory attempt to put the most favourable face on a probableforgery.As for the cross-eyed Q.C., he rose to reply with humorous confidence.Swaying his big body to and fro, he crumpled our will and our case inhis fat fingers like so much flimsy tissue-paper. Mr. Ashurst had made adisposition of his property twenty years ago--the right disposition, thenatural disposition; he had left the bulk of it as childless Englishgentlemen have ever been wont to leave their wealth--to the eldest sonof the eldest son of his family. The Honourable Marmaduke CourtneyAshurst, the testator, was the scion of a great house, which recentagricultural changes, he regretted to say, had relatively impoverished;he had come to the succour of that great house, as such a scion should,with his property acquired by honest industry elsewhere. It was fittingand reasonable that Mr. Ashurst should wish to see the Kynaston peerageregain, in the person of the amiable and accomplished young noblemanwhom he had the honour to represent, some portion of its ancient dignityand splendour.But jealousy and greed intervened. (Here he frowned at Harold.) Mr.Harold Tillington, the son of one of Mr. Ashurst's married sisters, castlonging eyes, as he had tried to suggest to them, on his cousin LordSouthminster's natural heritage. The result, he feared, was an unnaturalintrigue. Mr. Harold Tillington formed the acquaintance of a younglady--should we say young lady?--(he withered me with his glance)--well,yes, a lady, indeed, by birth and education, but an adventuress bychoice--a lady who, brought up in a respectable, though not (he mustadmit) a distinguished sphere, had lowered herself by accepting theposition of a lady's maid, and had trafficked in patent American cycleson the public high-roads of Germany and Switzerland. This clever anddesigning woman (he would grant her ability--he would grant her goodlooks) had fascinated Mr. Tillington--that was the theory he ventured tolay before the jury to-day; and the jury would see for themselves thatwhatever else the young lady might be, she had distinctly a certainouter gift of fascination. It was for them to decide whether Miss LoisCayley had or had not suggested to Mr. Harold Tillington the design ofsubstituting a forged will for Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's undeniabletestament. He would point out to them her singular connection with themissing man Higginson, whom the young lady herself described as a rogue,and from whom she had done her very best to dissociate herself in thiscourt--but ineffectually. Wherever Miss Cayley went, the man Higginsonwent independently. Such frequent recurrences, such apt juxtapositionscould hardly be set down to mere accidental coincidence.He went on to insinuate that Higginson and I had concocted the disputedwill between us; that we had passed it on to our fellow-conspirator,Harold; and that Harold had forged his uncle's signature to it, and hadappended those of the two supposed witnesses. But who, now, were thesewitnesses? One, Franz Markheim, was dead or missing; dead men tell notales: the other was obviously suggested by Higginson. It was his ownsister. Perhaps he forged her name to the document. Doubtless he thoughtthat family feeling would induce her, when it came to the pinch, toaccept and endorse her brother's lie; nay, he might even have beenfoolish enough to suppose that this cock-and-bull will would not bedisputed. If so, he and his master had reckoned without LordSouthminster, a gentleman who concealed beneath the careless exterior ofa man of fashion the solid intelligence of a man of affairs, and thehard head of a man not to be lightly cheated in matters of business.The alleged will had thus not a leg to stand upon. It was 'typewritten'(save the mark!) 'from dictation' at Florence, by whom? By the lady whohad most to gain from its success--the lady who was to be transformedfrom a shady adventuress, tossed about between Irish doctors and HinduMaharajahs, into the lawful wife of a wealthy diplomatist of noblefamily, on one condition only--if this pretended will could besatisfactorily established. The signatures were forgeries, as shown bythe expert evidence, and also by the oath of the one surviving witness.The will left all the estate--practically--to Mr. Harold Tillington, andfive hundred pounds to whom?--why, to the accomplice Higginson. Theminor bequests the Q.C. regarded as ingenious inventions, pure play offancy, 'intended to give artistic verisimilitude,' as Pooh-Bah says inthe opera, 'to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative.' The fads,it was true, were known fads of Mr. Ashurst's: but what sort of fads?Bimetallism? Anglo-Israel? No, braces and shoe-horns--clearly the kindthat would best be known to a courier like Higginson, the sole begetter,he believed, of this nefarious conspiracy.The cross-eyed Q.C., lifting his fat right hand in solemn adjuration,called upon the jury confidently to set aside this ridiculousfabrication, and declare for a will of undoubted genuineness, a willdrawn up in London by a firm of eminent solicitors, and preserved eversince by the testator's bankers. It would then be for his lordship todecide whether in the public interest he should recommend the Crown toprosecute on a charge of forgery the clumsy fabricator of thispreposterous document.The judge summed up--strongly in favour of Lord Southminster's will. Ifthe jury believed the experts and Miss Higginson, one verdict alone waspossible. The jury retired for three minutes only. It was a foregoneconclusion. They found for Lord Southminster. The judge, looking grave,concurred in their finding. A most proper verdict. And he considered itwould be the duty of the Public Prosecutor to pursue Mr. HaroldTillington on the charge of forgery.[Illustration: I REELED WHERE I SAT.]I reeled where I sat. Then I looked round for Harold.He had slipped from the court, unseen, during counsel's address, someminutes earlier!That distressed me more than anything else on that dreadful day. Iwished he had stood up in his place like a man to face this vile andcruel conspiracy.I walked out slowly, supported by Lady Georgina, who was as white as aghost herself, but very straight and scornful. 'I always knewSouthminster was a fool,' she said aloud; 'I always knew he was a sneak;but I did not know till now he was also a particularly bad type ofcriminal.'On the steps of the court, the pea-green young man met us. His air wasjaunty. 'Well, I was right, yah see,' he said, smiling and withdrawinghis cigarette. 'You backed the wrong fellah! I told you I'd win. I won'tsay moah now; this is not the time or place to recur to that subject;but, by-and-by, you'll come round; you'll think bettah of it still;you'll back the winnah!'I wished I were a man, that I might have the pleasure of kicking him.We drove back to my hotel and waited for Harold. To my horror and alarm,he never came near us. I might almost have doubted him--if he had notbeen Harold.I waited and waited. He did not come at all. He sent no word, nomessage. And all that evening we heard the newsboys shouting at the topof their voice in the street, 'Extra Speshul! the Ashurst Will Kise;Sensational Developments' 'Mysterious Disappearance of Mr. 'AroldTillington.'XITHE ADVENTURE OF THE ORIENTAL ATTENDANTI did not sleep that night. Next morning, I rose very early from arestless bed with a dry, hot mouth, and a general feeling that the solidearth had failed beneath me.Still no news from Harold! It was cruel, I thought. My faith almostflagged. He was a man and should be brave. How could he run away andhide himself at such a time? Even if I set my own anxiety aside, justthink to what serious misapprehension it laid him open!I sent out for the morning papers. They were full of Harold. Rumours,rumours, rumours! Mr. Tillington had deliberately chosen to put himselfin the wrong by disappearing mysteriously at the last moment. He hadonly himself to blame if the worst interpretation were put upon hisaction. But the police were on his track; Scotland Yard had 'a clue': itwas confidently expected an arrest would be made before evening atlatest. As to details, authorities differed. The officials of the GreatWestern Railway at Paddington were convinced that Mr. Tillington hadstarted, alone and undisguised, by the night express for Exeter. TheSouth-Eastern inspectors at Charing Cross, on the other hand, wereequally certain that he had slipped away with a false beard, in companywith his 'accomplice' Higginson, by the 8.15 P.M. to Paris. Everybodytook it for granted, however, that he had left London.Conjecture played with various ultimate destinations--Spain, Morocco,Sicily, the Argentine. In Italy, said the _Chronicle_, he might lurk fora while--he spoke Italian fluently, and could manage to put up at tiny_osterie_ in out-of-the-way places seldom visited by Englishmen. Hemight try Albania, said the _Morning Post_, airing its exclusive'society' information: he had often hunted there, and might in turn behunted. He would probably attempt to slink away to some remote spot inthe Carpathians or the Balkans, said the _Daily News_, quite proud ofits geography. Still, wherever he went, leaden-footed justice in thisage, said the _Times_, must surely overtake him. The day of universalextradition had dawned; we had no more Alsatias: even the Argentineitself gives up its rogues--at last; not an asylum for crime remains inEurope, not a refuge in Asia, Africa, America, Australia, or the PacificIslands.I noted with a shudder of horror that all the papers alike took hisguilt as certain. In spite of a few decent pretences at not prejudgingan untried cause, they treated him already as the detected criminal, thefugitive from justice. I sat in my little sitting-room at the hotel inJermyn Street, a limp rag, looking idly out of the window with swimmingeyes, and waiting for Lady Georgina. It was early, too early, but--oh,why didn't she come! Unless _somebody_ soon sympathised with me, myheart would break under this load of loneliness!Presently, as I looked out on the sloppy morning street, I was vaguelyaware through the mist that floated before my dry eyes (for tears weredenied me) of a very grand carriage driving up to the doorway--the porchwith the four wooden Ionic pillars. I took no heed of it. I was tooheart-sick for observation. My life was wrecked, and Harold's with it.Yet, dimly through the mist, I became conscious after a while that thecarriage was that of an Indian prince; I could see the black faces, thewhite turbans, the gold brocades of the attendants in the dickey. Thenit came home to me with a pang that this was the Maharajah.It was kindly meant; yet after all that had been insinuated in court theday before, I was by no means over-pleased that his dusky Highnessshould come to call upon me. Walls have eyes and ears. Reporters werehanging about all over London, eager to distinguish themselves bysuccessful eavesdropping. They would note, with brisk innuendoes aftertheir kind, how 'the Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar called early in theday on Miss Lois Cayley, with whom he remained for at least half an hourin close consultation.' I had half a mind to send down a message that Icould not see him. My face still burned with the undeserved shame of thecross-eyed Q.C.'s unspeakable suggestions.Before I could make my mind up, however, I saw to my surprise that theMaharajah did not propose to come in himself. He leaned back in hisplace with his lordly Eastern air, and waited, looking down on thegapers in the street, while one of the two gorgeous attendants in thedickey descended obsequiously to receive his orders. The man was dressedas usual in rich Oriental stuffs, and wore his full white turban swathedin folds round his head. I could not see his features. He bent forwardrespectfully with Oriental suppleness to take his Highness's orders.Then, receiving a card and bowing low, he entered the porch with thewooden Ionic pillars, and disappeared within, while the Maharajah foldedhis hands and seemed to resign himself to a temporary Nirvana.[Illustration: THE MESSENGER ENTERED.]A minute later, a knock sounded on my door. 'Come in!' I said, faintly;and the messenger entered.I turned and faced him. The blood rushed to my cheek. 'Harold!' I cried,darting forward. My joy overcame me. He folded me in his arms. I allowedhim, unreproved. For the first time he kissed me. I did not shrink fromit.Then I stood away a little and gazed at him. Even at that crucial momentof doubt and fear, I could not help noticing how admirably he made upas a handsome young Rajput. Three years earlier, at Schlangenbad, Iremembered he had struck me as strangely Oriental-looking: he had thefeatures of a high-born Indian gentleman, without the complexion. Hislarge, poetical eyes, his regular, oval face, his even teeth, his mouthand moustache, all vaguely recalled the highest type of the Easterntemperament. Now, he had blackened his face and hands with somepermanent stain--Indian ink, I learned later--and the resemblance to aRajput chief was positively startling. In his gold brocade and amplewhite turban, no passer-by, I felt sure, would ever have dreamt ofdoubting him.'Then you knew me at once?' he said, holding my face between his hands.'That's bad, darling! I flattered myself I had transformed my face intothe complete Indian.''Love has sharp eyes,' I answered. 'It can see through brick walls. Butthe disguise is perfect. No one else would detect you.''Love is blind, I thought.''Not where it ought to see. There, it pierces everything. I knew youinstantly, Harold. But all London, I am sure, would pass you by,unknown. You are absolute Orient.''That's well; for all London is looking for me,' he answered, bitterly.'The streets bristle with detectives. Southminster's knaveries have wonthe day. So I have tried this disguise. Otherwise, I should have beenarrested the moment the jury brought in their verdict.''And why were you not?' I asked, drawing back. 'Oh, Harold, I trustyou; but why did you disappear and make all the world believe youadmitted yourself guilty?'He opened his arms. 'Can't you guess?' he cried, holding them out tome.I nestled in them once more; but I answered through my tears--I hadfound tears now--'No Harold; it baffles me.''You remember what you promised me?' he murmured, leaning over me andclasping me. 'If ever I were poor, friendless, hunted--you would marryme. Now the opportunity has come when we can both prove ourselves.To-day, except you and dear Georgey, I haven't a friend in the world.Everyone else has turned against me. Southminster holds the field. I ama suspected forger; in a very few days I shall doubtless be a convictedfelon. Unjustly, as you know; yet still--we must face it--a convictedfelon. So I have come to claim you. I have come to ask you now, in thismoment of despair, will you keep your promise?'I lifted my face to his. He bent over it trembling. I whispered thewords in his ear. 'Yes, Harold, I will keep it. I have always loved you.And now I will marry you.''I knew you would!' he cried, and pressed me to his bosom.We sat for some minutes, holding each other's hands, and saying nothing;we were too full of thought for words. Then suddenly, Harold rousedhimself. 'We must make haste, darling,' he cried. 'We are keeping Partaboutside, and every minute is precious, every minute's delay dangerous.We ought to go down at once. Partab's carriage is waiting at the doorfor us.''Go down?' I exclaimed, clinging to him. 'How? Why? I don't understand.What is your programme?''Ah, I forgot I hadn't explained to you! Listen here, dearest--quick; Ican waste no words over it. I said just now I had no friends in theworld but you and Georgey. That's not true, for dear old Partab hasstuck to me nobly. When all my English friends fell away, the Rajputwas true to me. He arranged all this; it was his own idea; he foresawwhat was coming. He urged me yesterday, just before the verdict (when hesaw my acquaintances beginning to look askance), to slip quietly out ofcourt, and make my way by unobtrusive roads to his house in CurzonStreet. There, he darkened my face like his, and converted me toHinduism. I don't suppose the disguise will serve me for more than a dayor two; but it will last long enough for us to get safely away toScotland.''Scotland?' I murmured. 'Then you mean to try a Scotch marriage?''It is the only thing possible. We must be married to-day, and inEngland, of course, we cannot do it. We would have to be called inchurch, or else to procure a license, either of which would involvedisclosure of my identity. Besides, even the license would keep uswaiting about for a day or two. In Scotland, on the other hand, we canbe married at once. Partab's carriage is below, to take you to King'sCross. He is staunch as steel, dear fellow. Do you consent to go withme?'My faculty for promptly making up such mind as I possess stood me oncemore in good stead. 'Implicitly,' I answered. 'Dear Harold, thiscalamity has its happy side--for without it, much as I love you, I couldnever have brought myself to marry you!''One moment,' he cried. 'Before you go, recollect, this step isirrevocable. You will marry a man who may be torn from you this evening,and from whom fourteen years of prison may separate you.''I know it,' I cried, through my tears. 'But-- I shall be showing myconfidence in you, my love for you.'He kissed me once more, fervently. 'This makes amends for all,' hecried. 'Lois, to have won such a woman as you, I would go through it alla thousand times over. It was for this, and for this alone, that I hidmyself last night. I wanted to give you the chance of showing me howmuch, how truly you loved me.''And after we are married?' I asked, trembling.'I shall give myself up at once to the police in Edinburgh.'I clung to him wistfully. My heart half urged me to urge him to escape.But I knew that was wrong. 'Give yourself up, then,' I said, sobbing.'It is a brave man's place. You must stand your trial; and, come whatwill, I will strive to bear it with you.''I knew you would,' he cried. 'I was not mistaken in you.'We embraced again, just once. It was little enough after those years ofwaiting.'Now, come!' he cried. 'Let us go.'I drew back. 'Not with you, dearest,' I whispered. 'Not in theMaharajah's carriage. You must start by yourself. I will follow you atonce, to King's Cross, in a hansom.'He saw I was right. It would avoid suspicion, and it would prevent morescandal. He withdrew without a word. 'We meet,' I said, 'at ten, atKing's Cross Station.'I did not even wait to wash the tears from my eyes. All red as theywere, I put on my hat and my little brown travelling jacket. I don'tthink I so much as glanced once at the glass. The seconds were precious.I saw the Maharajah drive away, with Harold in the dickey, arms crossed,imperturbable, Orientally silent. He looked the very counterpart of theRajput by his side. Then I descended the stairs and walked out boldly.As I passed through the hall, the servants and the visitors stared at meand whispered. They spoke with nods and liftings of the eyebrows. I wasaware that that morning I had achieved notoriety.At Piccadilly Circus, I jumped of a sudden into a passing hansom.'King's Cross!' I cried, as I mounted the step. 'Drive quick! I have notime to spare.' And, as the man drove off, I saw, by a convulsive dartof someone across the road, that I had given the slip to a disappointedreporter.At the station I took a first-class ticket for Edinburgh. On theplatform, the Maharajah and his attendants were waiting. He lifted hishat to me, though otherwise he took no overt notice. But I saw his keeneyes follow me down the train. Harold, in his Oriental dress, pretendednot to observe me. One or two porters, and a few curious travellers,cast inquiring eyes on the Eastern prince, and made remarks about him toone another. 'That's the chap as was up yesterday in the Ashurst willkise!' said one lounger to his neighbour. But nobody seemed to look atHarold; his subordinate position secured him from curiosity. TheMaharajah had always two Eastern servants, gorgeously dressed, inattendance; he had been a well-known figure in London society, and atLord's and the Oval, for two or three seasons.'Bloomin' fine cricketer!' one porter observed to his mate as he passed.'Yuss; not so dusty for a nigger,' the other man replied. 'Fust-ritebowler; but, Lord, he can't 'old a candle to good old Ranji.'As for myself, nobody seemed to recognise me. I set this fact down tothe fortunate circumstance that the evening papers had published roughwood-cuts which professed to be my portrait, and which naturally led thepublic to look out for a brazen-faced, raw-boned, hard-featuredtermagant.I took my seat in a ladies' compartment by myself. As the train wasabout to start, Harold strolled up as if casually for a moment. 'Youthink it better so?' he queried, without moving his lips or seeming tolook at me.'Decidedly,' I answered. 'Go back to Partab. Don't come near me againtill we get to Edinburgh. It is dangerous still. The police may at anymoment hear we have started and stop us half-way; and now that we haveonce committed ourselves to this plan it would be fatal to beinterrupted before we have got married.''You are right,' he cried; 'Lois, you are always right, somehow.'I wished I could think so myself; but 'twas with serious misgivings thatI felt the train roll out of the station.Oh, that long journey north, alone, in a ladies' compartment--with thefeeling that Harold was so near, yet so unapproachable: it was anendless agony. _He_ had the Maharajah, who loved and admired him, tokeep him from brooding; but I, left alone, and confined with my ownfears, conjured up before my eyes every possible misfortune that Heavencould send us. I saw clearly now that if we failed in our purpose thisjourney would be taken by everyone for a flight, and would deepen thesuspicion under which we both laboured. It would make me still moreobviously a conspirator with Harold.Whatever happened, we must strain every nerve to reach Scotland insafety, and then to get married, in order that Harold might immediatelysurrender himself.[Illustration: HE TOOK A LONG, CARELESS STARE AT ME.]At York, I noticed with a thrill of terror that a man in plain clothes,with the obtrusively unobtrusive air of a detective, looked carefullythough casually into every carriage. I felt sure he was a spy, becauseof his marked outer jauntiness of demeanour, which hardly masked anunderlying hang-dog expression of scrutiny. When he reached my place,he took a long, careless stare at me--a seemingly careless stare, whichwas yet brim-full of the keenest observation. Then he paced slowly alongthe line of carriages, with a glance at each, till he arrived justopposite the Maharajah's compartment. There he stared hard once more.The Maharajah descended; so did Harold and the Hindu attendant, who wasdressed just like him. The man I took for a detective indulged in afrank, long gaze at the unconscious Indian prince, but cast only a hastyeye on the two apparent followers. That touch of revelation relieved mymind a little. I felt convinced the police were watching the Maharajahand myself, as suspicious persons connected with the case; but they hadnot yet guessed that Harold had disguised himself as one of the twoinvariable Rajput servants.We steamed on northward. At Newcastle, the same detective strolled, withhis hands in his pockets, along the train once more, and puffed a cigarwith the nonchalant air of a sporting gentleman. But I was certain now,from the studious unconcern he was anxious to exhibit, that he must be aspy upon us. He overdid his mood of careless observation. It was tooobvious an assumption. Precisely the same thing happened again when wepulled up at Berwick. I knew now that we were watched. It would beimpossible for us to get married at Edinburgh if we were thus closelypursued. There was but one chance open; we must leave the train abruptlyat the first Scotch stopping station.The detective knew we were booked through for Edinburgh. So much I couldtell, because I saw him make inquiries of the ticket examiner at York,and again at Berwick, and because the ticket-examiner thereupon entereda mental note of the fact as he punched my ticket each time: 'Oh,Edinburgh, miss? All right'; and then stared at me suspiciously. I couldtell he had heard of the Ashurst will case. He also lingered long aboutthe Maharajah's compartment, and then went back to confer with thedetective. Thus, putting two and two together, as a woman will, I cameto the conclusion that the spy did not expect us to leave the trainbefore we reached Edinburgh. That told in our favour. Most men trustmuch to just such vague expectations. They form a theory, and thenneglect the adverse chances. You can only get the better of a skilleddetective by taking him thus, psychologically and humanly.By this time, I confess, I felt almost like a criminal. Never in my lifehad danger loomed so near--not even when we returned with the Arabs fromthe oasis. For then we feared for our lives alone; now, we feared forour honour.I drew a card from my case before we left Berwick station, and scribbleda few hasty words on it in German. 'We are watched. A detective! If werun through to Edinburgh, we shall doubtless be arrested or at leastimpeded. This train will stop at Dunbar for one minute. Just before itleaves again, get out as quietly as you can--at the last moment. I willalso get out and join you. Let Partab go on; it will excite lessattention. The scheme I suggest is the only safe plan. If you agree, assoon as we have well started from Berwick, shake your handkerchiefunobtrusively out of your carriage window.'[Illustration: I BECKONED A PORTER.]I beckoned a porter noiselessly without one word. The detective was nowstrolling along the fore-part of the train, with his back turned towardsme, peering as he went into all the windows. I gave the porter ashilling. 'Take this to a black gentleman in the next carriage but one,'I said, in a confidential whisper. The porter touched his hat, nodded,smiled, and took it.Would Harold see the necessity for acting on my advice?-- I wondered. Igazed out along the train as soon as we had got well clear of Berwick. Aminute--two minutes--three minutes passed; and still no handkerchief. Ibegan to despair. He was debating, no doubt. If he refused, all waslost, and we were disgraced for ever.At last, after long waiting, as I stared still along the whizzing line,with the smoke in my eyes, and the dust half blinding me, I saw, to myintense relief, a handkerchief flutter. It fluttered once, not markedly,then a black hand withdrew it. Only just in time, for even as itdisappeared, the detective's head thrust itself out of a farther window.He was not looking for anything in particular, as far as I couldtell--just observing the signals. But it gave me a strange thrill tothink even now we were so nearly defeated.My next trouble was--would the train draw up at Dunbar? The 10 A.M. fromKing's Cross is not set down to stop there in Bradshaw, for nopassengers are booked to or from the station by the day express; but Iremembered from of old when I lived at Edinburgh, that it used always towait about a minute for some engine-driver's purpose. This doubt filledme with fresh fear; did it draw up there still?--they have acceleratedthe service so much of late years, and abolished so many old accustomedstoppages. I counted the familiar stations with my breath held back.They seemed so much farther apart than usual. Reston--Grant'sHouse--Cockburnspath--Innerwick.The next was Dunbar. If we rolled past _that_, then all was lost. Wecould never get married. I trembled and hugged myself.The engine screamed. Did that mean she was running through? Oh, how Iwished I had learned the interpretation of the signals!Then gradually, gently, we began to slow. Were we slowing to pass thestation only? No; with a jolt she drew up. My heart gave a bound as Iread the word 'Dunbar' on the station notice-board.I rose and waited, with my fingers on the door. Happily it had one ofthose new-fashioned slip-latches which open from inside. No need tobetray myself prematurely to the detective by a hand displayed on theouter handle. I glanced out at him cautiously. His head was thrustthrough his window, and his sloping shoulders revealed the spy, but hewas looking the other way--observing the signals, doubtless, to discoverwhy we stopped at a place not mentioned in Bradshaw.Harold's face just showed from another window close by. Too soon or toolate might either of them be fatal. He glanced inquiry at me. I noddedback, 'Now!' The train gave its first jerk, a faint backward jerk,indicative of the nascent intention of starting. As it braced itself togo on, I jumped out; so did Harold. We faced one another on the platformwithout a word. 'Stand away there:' the station-master cried, in anangry voice. The guard waved his green flag. The detective, stillabsorbed on the signals, never once looked back. One second later, wewere safe at Dunbar, and he was speeding away by the express forEdinburgh.It gave us a breathing space of about an hour.[Illustration: YOU CAN'T GET OUT HERE, HE SAID, CRUSTILY.]For half a minute I could not speak. My heart was in my mouth. I hardlyeven dared to look at Harold. Then the station-master stalked up to uswith a threatening manner. 'You can't get out here,' he said, crustily,in a gruff Scotch voice. 'This train is not timed to set down beforeEdinburgh.''We _have_ got out,' I answered, taking it upon me to speak for myfellow-culprit, the Hindu--as he was to all seeming. 'The logic of factsis with us. We were booked through to Edinburgh, but we wanted to stopat Dunbar; and as the train happened to pull up, we thought we needn'twaste time by going on all that way and then coming back again.''Ye should have changed at Berwick,' the station-master said, stillgruffly, 'and come on by the slow train.' I could see his carefulScotch soul was vexed (incidentally) at our extravagance in paying theextra fare to Edinburgh and back again.In spite of agitation, I managed to summon up one of my sweetestsmiles--a smile that ere now had melted the hearts of rickshaw cooliesand of French _douaniers_. He thawed before it visibly. 'Time wasimportant to us,' I said--oh, he guessed not how important; 'andbesides, you know, it is so good for the company!''That's true,' he answered, mollified. He could not tilt against theinterests of the North British shareholders. 'But how about yer luggage?It'll have gone on to Edinburgh, I'm thinking.''We _have_ no luggage,' I answered boldly.He stared at us both, puckered his brow a moment, and then burst outlaughing. 'Oh, ay, I see,' he answered, with a comic air of amusement.'Well, well, it's none of my business, no doubt, and I will notinterfere with ye; though why a lady like you----' He glanced curiouslyat Harold.I saw he had guessed right, and thought it best to throw myselfunreservedly on his mercy. Time was indeed important. I glanced at thestation clock. It was not very far from the stroke of six, and we mustmanage to get married before the detective could miss us at Edinburgh,where he was due at 6.30.So I smiled once more, that heart-softening smile. 'We have each our ownfancies,' I said blushing--and, indeed (such is the pride of race amongwomen), I felt myself blush in earnest at the bare idea that I wasmarrying a black man, in spite of our good Maharajah's kindness. 'He isa gentleman, and a man of education and culture.' I thought thatrecommendation ought to tell with a Scotchman. 'We are in sore straitsnow, but our case is a just one. Can you tell me who in this place ismost likely to sympathise--most likely to marry us?'He looked at me--and surrendered at discretion. 'I should think anybodywould marry ye who saw yer pretty face and heard yer sweet voice,' heanswered. 'But, perhaps, ye'd better present yerself to Mr. Schoolcraft,the U.P. minister at Little Kirkton. He was aye soft-hearted.''How far from here?' I asked.'About two miles,' he answered.'Can we get a trap?''Oh ay, there's machines always waiting at the station.'[Illustration: WE TOLD OUR TALE.]We interviewed a 'machine,' and drove out to Little Kirkton. There, wetold our tale in the fewest words possible to the obliging andgood-natured U.P. minister. He looked, as the station-master had said,'soft-hearted'; but he dashed our hopes to the ground at once by tellingus candidly that unless we had had our residence in Scotland fortwenty-one days immediately preceding the marriage, it would not belegal. 'If you were Scotch,' he added, 'I could go through the ceremonyat once, of course; and then you could apply to the sheriff to-night forleave to register the marriage in proper form afterward: but as one ofyou is English, and the other I judge'--he smiled and glanced towardsHarold--'an Indian-born subject of Her Majesty, it would be impossiblefor me to do it: the ceremony would be invalid, under Lord Brougham'sAct, without previous residence.'This was a terrible blow. I looked away appealingly. 'Harold,' I criedin despair, 'do you think we could manage to hide ourselves safelyanywhere in Scotland for twenty-one days?'His face fell. 'How could I escape notice? All the world is hunting forme. And then the scandal! No matter where you stopped--however far fromme--no, Lois darling, I could never expose you to it.'The minister glanced from one to the other of us, puzzled. 'Harold?' hesaid, turning over the word on his tongue. 'Harold? That doesn't soundlike an Indian name, does it? And----' he hesitated, 'you speakwonderful English!'I saw the safest plan was to make a clean breast of it. He looked thesort of man one could trust on an emergency. 'You have heard of theAshurst will case?' I said, blurting it out suddenly.'I have seen something about it in the newspapers; yes. But it did notinterest me: I have not followed it.'I told him the whole truth; the case against us--the facts as we knewthem. Then I added, slowly, 'This is Mr. Harold Tillington, whom theyaccuse of forgery. Does he look like a forger? I want to marry himbefore he is tried. It is the only way by which I can prove my implicittrust in him. As soon as we are married, he will give himself up at onceto the police--if you wish it, before your eyes. But married we must be._Can't_ you manage it somehow?'My pleading voice touched him. 'Harold Tillington?' he murmured. 'I knowof his forebears. Lady Guinevere Tillington's son, is it not? Then youmust be Younger of Gledcliffe.' For Scotland is a village: everyone init seems to have heard of every other.''What does he mean?' I asked. 'Younger of Gledcliffe?' I remembered nowthat the phrase had occurred in Mr. Ashurst's will, though I neverunderstood it.'A Scotch fashion,' Harold answered. 'The heir to a laird is calledYounger of so-and-so. My father has a small estate of that name inDumfriesshire; a _very_ small estate: I was born and brought up there.''Then you are a Scotchman?' the minister asked.'Yes,' Harold answered frankly: 'by remote descent. We are trebly of thefemale line at Gledcliffe; still, I am no doubt more or less Scotch bydomicile.''Younger of Gledcliffe! Oh, yes, that ought certainly to be quitesufficient for our purpose. Do you live there?''I have been living there lately. I always live there when I'm inBritain. It is my only home. I belong to the diplomatic service.''But then--the lady?''She is unmitigatedly English,' Harold admitted, in a gloomy voice.'Not quite,' I answered. 'I lived four years in Edinburgh. And I spentmy holidays there while I was at Girton. I keep my boxes still at my oldrooms in Maitland Street.''Oh, that will do,' the minister answered, quite relieved; for it wasclear that our anxiety and the touch of romance in our tale had enlistedhim in our favour. 'Indeed, now I come to think of it, it suffices forthe Act if one only of the parties is domiciled in Scotland. And as Mr.Tillington lives habitually at Gledcliffe, that settles the question.Still, I can do nothing save marry you now by religious service in thepresence of my servants--which constitutes what we call anecclesiastical marriage--it becomes legal if afterwards registered; andthen you must apply to the sheriff for a warrant to register it. But Iwill do what I can; later on, if you like, you can be re-married by therites of your own Church in England.''Are you quite sure our Scotch domicile is good enough in law?' Haroldasked, still doubtful.'I can turn it up, if you wish. I have a legal handbook. Before LordBrougham's Act, no formalities were necessary. But the Act was passed toprevent Gretna Green marriages. The usual phrase is that such a marriagedoes not hold good unless one or other of the parties either has had hisor her usual residence in Scotland, or else has lived there fortwenty-one days immediately preceding the date of the marriage. If youlike, I will wait to consult the authorities.''No, thank you,' I cried. 'There is no time to lose. Marry us first, andlook it up afterwards. \\\"One or other\\\" will do, it seems. Mr. Tillingtonis Scotch enough, I am sure; he has no address in Britain butGledcliffe: we will rest our claim upon that. Even if the marriage turnsout invalid, we only remain where we were. This is a preliminaryceremony to prove good faith, and to bind us to one another. We cansatisfy the law, if need be, when we return to England.'The minister called in his wife and servants, and explained to thembriefly. He exhorted us and prayed. We gave our solemn consent in legalform before two witnesses. Then he pronounced us duly married. In aquarter of an hour more, we had made declaration to that effect beforethe sheriff, the witnesses accompanying us, and were formally affirmedto be man and wife before the law of Great Britain. I asked if it wouldhold in England as well.'You couldn't be firmer married,' the sheriff said, with decision, 'bythe Archbishop of Canterbury in Westminster Abbey.'Harold turned to the minister. 'Will you send for the police?' he said,calmly. 'I wish to inform them that I am the man for whom they arelooking in the Ashurst will case.'Our own cabman went to fetch them. It was a terrible moment. But Haroldsat in the sheriff's study and waited, as if nothing unusual werehappening. He talked freely but quietly. Never in my life had I felt soproud of him.At last the police came, much inflated with the dignity of so great acapture, and took down our statement. 'Do you give yourself in charge ona confession of forgery?' the superintendent asked, as Harold ended.'Certainly not,' Harold answered. 'I have not committed forgery. But Ido not wish to skulk or hide myself. I understand a warrant is outagainst me in London. I have come to Scotland, hurriedly, for the sakeof getting married, not to escape apprehension. I am here, openly,under my own name. I tell you the facts; 'tis for you to decide; if youchoose, you can arrest me.'The superintendent conferred for some time in another room with thesheriff. Then he returned to the study. 'Very well, sir,' he said, in arespectful tone, 'I arrest you.'So that was the beginning of our married life. More than ever, I feltsure I could trust in Harold.The police decided, after hearing by telegram from London, that we mustgo up at once by the night express, which they stopped for the purpose.They were forced to divide us. I took the sleeping-car; Harold travelledwith two constables in a ordinary carriage. Strange to say,notwithstanding all this, so great was our relief from the tension ofour flight, that we both slept soundly.Next morning we arrived in London, Harold guarded. The police hadarranged that the case should come up at Bow Street that afternoon. Itwas not an ideal honeymoon, and yet, I was somehow happy.At King's Cross, they took him away from me. Still, I hardly cried. Allthe way up in the train, whenever I was awake, an idea had been hauntingme--a possible clue to this trickery of Lord Southminster's. Pettydetails cropped up and fell into their places. I began to unravel it allnow. I had an inkling of a plan to set Harold right again.The will we had proved----but I must not anticipate.When we parted, Harold kissed me on the forehead, and murmured rathersadly, 'Now, I suppose it's all up. Lois, I must go. These rogues havebeen too much for us.'[Illustration: I HAVE FOUND A CLUE.]'Not a bit of it,' I answered, new hope growing stronger and strongerwithin me. 'I see a way out. I have found a clue. I believe, dearHarold, the right will still be vindicated.'And red-eyed as I was, I jumped into a hansom, and called to the cabmanto drive at once to Lady Georgina's.XIITHE ADVENTURE OF THE UNPROFESSIONAL DETECTIVE'Is Lady Georgina at home?' The discreet man-servant in sober blackclothes eyed me suspiciously. 'No, miss,' he answered. 'That is tosay--no, ma'am. Her ladyship is still at Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst's--thelate Mr. Marmaduke Ashurst, I mean--in Park Lane North. You know thenumber, ma'am?''Yes, I know it,' I replied, with a gasp; for this was indeed a triumph.My one fear had been lest Lord Southminster should already have takenpossession--why, you will see hereafter; and it relieved me to learnthat Lady Georgina was still at hand to guard my husband's interests.She had been living at the house, practically, since her brother'sdeath. I drove round with all speed, and flung myself into my dear oldlady's arms.'Kiss me,' I cried, flushed. 'I am your niece!' But she knew it already,for our movements had been fully reported by this time (with picturesqueadditions) in the morning papers. Imagination, ill-developed in theEnglish race, seems to concentrate itself in the lower order ofjournalists.She kissed me on both cheeks with unwonted tenderness. 'Lois,' shecried, with tears in her eyes, 'you're a brick!' It was not exactlypoetical at such a moment, but from her it meant more than much gushingphraseology.'And you're here in possession!' I murmured.[Illustration: I'VE HELD THE FORT BY MAIN FORCE.]The Cantankerous Old Lady nodded. She was in her element, I must admit.She dearly loved a row--above all, a family row; but to be in the thickof a family row, and to feel herself in the right, with the law againsther--that was joy such as Lady Georgina had seldom before experienced.'Yes, dear,' she burst out volubly, 'I'm in possession, thank Heaven.And what's more, they won't oust me without a legal process. I've beenhere, off and on, you know, ever since poor dear Marmy died, lookingafter things for Harold; and I shall look after them still, till BertieSouthminster succeeds in ejecting me, which won't be easy. Oh, I've heldthe fort by main force, I can tell you; held it like a Trojan. Bertie'sin a precious great hurry to move in, I can see; but I won't allow him.He's been down here this morning, fatuously blustering, and trying tocarry the post by storm, with a couple of policemen.''Policemen!' I cried. 'To turn you out?''Yes, my dear, policemen: but (the Lord be praised) I was too much forhim. There are legal formalities to fulfil yet; and I won't budge aninch, Lois, not one inch, my dear, till he's fulfilled every one ofthem. Mark my words, child, that boy's up to some devilry.''He is,' I answered.'Yes, he wouldn't be in such a rampaging hurry to get in--being as lazyas he's empty-headed--takes after Gwendoline in that--if he hadn't someexcellent reason for wishing to take possession: and depend upon it, thereason is that he wants to get hold of something or other that'sHarold's. But he sha'n't if I can help it; and, thank my stars, I'm adour woman to reckon with. If he comes, he comes over my old bones,child. I've been overhauling everything of Marmy's, I can tell you, tocheckmate the boy if I can; but I've found nothing yet, and till I'vesatisfied myself on that point, I'll hold the fort still, if I have tobarricade that pasty-faced scoundrel of a nephew of mine out by pilingthe furniture against the front door-- I will, as sure as my name'sGeorgina Fawley!''I know you will, dear,' I assented, kissing her, 'and so I shallventure to leave you, while I go out to institute another littleenquiry.''What enquiry?'I shook my head. 'It's only a surmise,' I said, hesitating. 'I'll tellyou about it later. I've had time to think while I've been coming backin the train, and I've thought of many things. Mount guard till Ireturn, and mind you don't let Lord Southminster have access toanything.''I'll shoot him first, dear.' And I believe she meant it.I drove on in the same cab to Harold's solicitor. There I laid my freshdoubts at once before him. He rubbed his bony hands. 'You've hit it!' hecried, charmed. 'My dear madam, you've hit it! I never did like thatwill. I never did like the signatures, the witnesses, the look of it.But what could I do? Mr. Tillington propounded it. Of course it wasn'tmy business to go dead against my own client.''Then you doubted Harold's honour, Mr. Hayes?' I cried, flushing.[Illustration: NEVER! HE ANSWERED. NEVER!]'Never!' he answered. 'Never! I felt sure there must be some mistakesomewhere, but not any trickery on--your husband's part. Now, _you_supply the right clue. We must look into this, immediately.'He hurried round with me at once in the same cab to the court. Theincriminated will had been 'impounded,' as they call it; but, undercertain restrictions, and subject to the closest surveillance, I wasallowed to examine it with my husband's solicitor, before the eyes ofthe authorities. I looked at it long with the naked eye and also with asmall pocket lens. The paper, as I had noted before, was the same kindof foolscap as that which I had been in the habit of using at my officein Florence; and the typewriting--was it mine? The longer I looked atit, the more I doubted it.After a careful examination I turned round to our solicitor. 'Mr.Hayes,' I said, firmly, having arrived at my conclusion, 'this is _not_the document I type-wrote at Florence.''How do you know?' he asked. 'A different machine? Some smallpeculiarity in the shape of the letters?''No, the rogue who typed this will was too cunning for that. He didn'tallow himself to be foiled by such a scholar's mate. It is written witha Spread Eagle, the same sort of machine precisely as my own. I know thetype perfectly. But----' I hesitated.'But what?''Well, it is difficult to explain. There is character in typewriting,just as there is in handwriting, only, of course, not quite so much ofit. Every operator is liable to his own peculiar tricks and blunders.If I had some of my own typewritten manuscript here to show you, I couldsoon make that evident.''I can easily believe it. Individuality runs through all we do, howeverseemingly mechanical. But are the points of a sort that you could makeclear in court to the satisfaction of a jury?''I think so. Look here, for example. Certain letters get habituallymixed up in typewriting; _c_ and _v_ stand next one another on thekeyboard of the machine, and the person who typed this draft sometimesstrikes a _c_ instead of a _v_, or _vice vers\\u00e2_. I never do that. Theletters I tend to confuse are _s_ and _w_, or else _e_ and _r_, whichalso come very near one another in the arbitrary arrangement. Besides,when I type-wrote the original of this will, I made no errors at all; Itook such very great pains about it.''And this person did make errors?''Yes; struck the wrong letter first, and then corrected it often bystriking another rather hard on top of it. See, this was a _v_ to beginwith, and he turned it into a _c_. Besides, the hand that wrote thiswill is heavier than mine: it comes down _thump_, _thump_, _thump_,while mine glides lightly. And the hyphens are used with a space betweenthem, and the character of the punctuation is not exactly as I make it.''Still,' Mr. Hayes objected, 'we have nothing but your word. I'm afraid,in such a case, we could never induce a jury to accept your unsupportedevidence.''I don't want them to accept it,' I answered. 'I am looking this up formy own satisfaction. I want to know, first, who wrote this will. And ofone thing I am quite clear: it is _not_ the document I drew up for Mr.Ashurst. Just look at that _x_. The _x_ alone is conclusive. Mytypewriter had the upper right-hand stroke of the small _x_ badlyformed, or broken, while this one is perfect. I remember it well,because I used always to improve all my lower-case _x_'s with a pen whenI re-read and corrected. I see their dodge clearly now. It is a mostdiabolical conspiracy. Instead of forging a will in Lord Southminster'sfavour, they have substituted a forgery for the real will, and thenmanaged to make my poor Harold prove it.''In that case, no doubt, they have destroyed the real one, theoriginal,' Mr. Hayes put in.'I don't think so,' I answered, after a moment's deliberation. 'Fromwhat I know of Mr. Ashurst, I don't believe it is likely he would haveleft his will about carelessly anywhere. He was a secretive man, fond ofmysteries and mystifications. He would be sure to conceal it. Besides,Lady Georgina and Harold have been taking care of everything in thehouse ever since he died.''But,' Mr. Hayes objected, 'the forger of this document, supposing it tobe forged, must have had access to the original, since you say the termsof the two are identical; only the signatures are forgeries. And if hesaw and copied it, why might he not also have destroyed it?'A light flashed across me all at once. 'The forger _did_ see theoriginal,' I cried, 'but not the fair copy. I have it all now! I detecttheir trick! It comes back to me vividly! When I had finished typing thecopy at Florence from my first rough draft, which I had taken down onthe machine before Mr. Ashurst's eyes, I remember now that I threw theoriginal into the waste-paper basket. It must have been there thatevening when Higginson called and asked for the will to take it back toMr. Ashurst. He called for it, no doubt, hoping to open the packetbefore he delivered it and make a copy of the document for this verypurpose. But I refused to let him have it. Before he saw me, however,he had been left by himself for ten minutes in the office; for Iremember coming out to him and finding him there alone: and during thatten minutes, being what he is, you may be sure he fished out the roughdraft and appropriated it!'[Illustration: WE SHALL HAVE HIM IN OUR POWER.]'That is more than likely,' my solicitor nodded. 'You are tracking himto his lair. We shall have him in our power.'I grew more and more excited as the whole cunning plot unravelled itselfmentally step by step before me. 'He must then have gone to LordSouthminster,' I went on, 'and told him of the legacy he expected fromMr. Ashurst. It was five hundred pounds--a mere trifle to Higginson, whoplays for thousands. So he must have offered to arrange matters for LordSouthminster if Southminster would consent to make good that sum and agreat deal more to him. That odious little cad told me himself on the_Jumna_ they were engaged in pulling off \\\"a big _coup_\\\" between them. Hethought then I would marry him, and that he would so secure myconnivance in his plans; but who would marry such a piece of moist clay?Besides, I could never have taken anyone but Harold.' Then another cluecame home to me. 'Mr. Hayes,' I cried, jumping at it, 'Higginson, whoforged this will, never saw the real document itself at all; he saw onlythe draft: for Mr. Ashurst altered one word _viva voce_ in the originalat the last moment, and I made a pencil note of it on my cuff at thetime: and see, it isn't here, though I inserted it in the final cleancopy of the will--the word 'especially.' It grows upon me more and moreeach minute that the real instrument is hidden somewhere in Mr.Ashurst's house--Harold's house--our house; and that _because_ it isthere Lord Southminster is so indecently anxious to oust his aunt andtake instant possession.''In that case,' Mr. Hayes remarked, 'we had better go back to LadyGeorgina without one minute's delay, and, while she still holds thehouse, institute a thorough search for it.'No sooner said than done. We jumped again into our cab and started. Aswe drove back, Mr. Hayes asked me where I thought we were most likely tofind it.'In a secret drawer in Mr. Ashurst's desk,' I answered, by a flash ofinstinct, without a second's hesitation.'How do you know there's a secret drawer?''I don't know it. I infer it from my general knowledge of Mr. Ashurst'scharacter. He loved secret drawers, ciphers, cryptograms,mystery-mongering.''But it was in that desk that your husband found the forged document,'the lawyer objected.Once more I had a flash of inspiration or intuition. 'Because White, Mr.Ashurst's valet, had it in readiness in his possession,' I answered,'and hid it there, in the most obvious and unconcealed place he couldfind, as soon as the breath was out of his master's body. I remember nowLord Southminster gave himself away to some extent in that matter. Thehateful little creature isn't really clever enough, for all hiscunning,--and with Higginson to back him,--to mix himself up in suchtricks as forgery. He told me at Aden he had had a telegram from\\\"Marmy's valet,\\\" to report progress; and he received another, the nightMr. Ashurst died, at Moozuffernuggar. Depend upon it, White was more orless in this plot; Higginson left him the forged will when they startedfor India; and, as soon as Mr. Ashurst died, White hid it where Haroldwas bound to find it.''If so,' Mr. Hayes answered, 'that's well; we have something to go upon.The more of them, the better. There is safety in numbers--for the honestfolk. I never knew three rogues hold long together, especially whenthreatened with a criminal prosecution. Their confederacy breaks downbefore the chance of punishment. Each tries to screen himself bybetraying the others.''Higginson was the soul of this plot,' I went on. 'Of that you may besure. He's a wily old fox, but we'll run him to earth yet. The more Ithink of it, the more I feel sure, from what I know of Mr. Ashurst'scharacter, he would never have put that will in so exposed a place asthe one where Harold says he found it.'We drew up at the door of the disputed house just in time for the siege.Mr. Hayes and I walked in. We found Lady Georgina face to face with LordSouthminster. The opposing forces were still at the stage ofpreliminaries of warfare.'Look heah,' the pea-green young man was observing, in his drawlingvoice, as we entered; 'it's no use your talking, deah Georgey. Thishouse is mine, and I won't have you meddling with it.''This house is not yours, you odious little scamp,' his aunt retorted,raising her shrill voice some notes higher than usual; 'and while I canhold a stick you shall not come inside it.''Very well, then; you drive me to hostilities, don't yah know. I'm sorryto show disrespect to your gray hairs--if any--but I shall be obliged tocall in the police to eject yah.''Call them in if you like,' I answered, interposing between them. 'Goout and get them! Mr. Hayes, while he's gone, send for a carpenter tobreak open the back of Mr. Ashurst's escritoire.''A carpentah?' he cried, turning several degrees whiter than his pastywont. 'What for? A carpentah?'I spoke distinctly. 'Because we have reason to believe Mr. Ashurst'sreal will is concealed in this house in a secret drawer, and because thekeys were in the possession of White, whom we believe to be youraccomplice in this shallow conspiracy.'He gasped and looked alarmed. 'No, you don't,' he cried, steppingbriskly forward. 'You don't, I tell yah! Break open Marmy's desk! Why,hang it all, it's my property.''We shall see about that after we've broken it open,' I answered grimly.'Here, this screw-driver will do. The back's not strong. Now, your help,Mr. Hayes--one, two, three; we can prise it apart between us.'Lord Southminster rushed up and tried to prevent us. But Lady Georgina,seizing both wrists, held him tight as in a vice with her dear skinnyold hands. He writhed and struggled all in vain: he could not escapeher. 'I've often spanked you, Bertie,' she cried, 'and if you attempt tointerfere, I'll spank you again; that's the long and the short of it!'He broke from her and rushed out, to call the police, I believe, andprevent our desecration of pooah Marmy's property.[Illustration: VICTORY.]Inside the first shell were several locked drawers, and two or threeopen ones, out of one of which Harold had fished the false will.Instinct taught me somehow that the central drawer on the left-hand sidewas the compartment behind which lay the secret receptacle. I prised itapart and peered about inside it. Presently I saw a slip-panel, which Itouched with one finger. The pigeon-hole flew open and disclosed anarrow slit I clutched at something--the will! Ho, victory! the will! Iraised it aloft with a wild shout. Not a doubt of it! The real, thegenuine document!We turned it over and read it. It was my own fair copy, written atFlorence, and bearing all the small marks of authenticity about it whichI had pointed out to Mr. Hayes as wanting to the forged and impoundeddocument. Fortunately, Lady Georgina and four of the servants had stoodby throughout this scene, and had watched our demeanour, as well as LordSouthminster's.We turned next to the signatures. The principal one was clearly Mr.Ashurst's-- I knew it at once--his legible fat hand, 'Marmaduke CourtneyAshurst.' And then the witnesses? They fairly took our breath away.'Why, Higginson's sister isn't one of them at all,' Mr. Hayes cried,astonished.A flush of remorse came over me. I saw it all now. I had misjudged thatpoor woman! She had the misfortune to be a rogue's sister, but, asHarold had said, was herself a most respectable and blameless person.Higginson must have forged her name to the document; that was all; andshe had naturally sworn that she never signed it. He knew her honesty.It was a master-stroke of rascality.'The other one isn't here, either,' I exclaimed, growing more puzzled.'The waiter at the hotel! Why, that's another forgery! Higginson musthave waited till the man was safely dead, and then used him similarly.It was all very clever. Now, who are these people who really witnessedit?''The first one,' Mr. Hayes said, examining the handwriting, 'is SirRoger Bland, the Dorsetshire baronet: he's dead, poor fellow; but hewas at Florence at the time, and I can answer for his signature. He wasa client of mine, and died at Mentone. The second is Captain Richards,of the Mounted Police: he's living still, but he's away in SouthAfrica.''Then they risked his turning up?''If they knew who the real witnesses were at all--which is doubtful. Yousee, as you say, they may have seen the rough draft only.''Higginson would know,' I answered. 'He was with Mr. Ashurst at Florenceat the time, and he would take good care to keep a watch upon hismovements. In my belief, it was he who suggested this whole plot to LordSouthminster.''Of course it was,' Lady Georgina put in. 'That's absolutely certain.Bertie's a rogue as well as a fool: but he's too great a fool to inventa clever roguery, and too great a knave not to join in it foolishly whenanybody else takes the pains to invent it.''And it _was_ a clever roguery,' Mr. Hayes interposed. 'An ordinaryrascal would have forged a later will in Lord Southminster's favour andrun the risk of detection; Higginson had the acuteness to forge a willexactly like the real one, and to let your husband bear the burden ofthe forgery. It was as sagacious as it was ruthless.''The next point,' I said, 'will be for us to prove it.'At that moment the bell rang, and one of the house-servants--all puzzledby this conflict of interests--came in with a telegram, which he handedme on a salver. I broke it open, without glancing at the envelope. Itscontents baffled me: 'My address is Hotel Bristol, Paris; name as usual.Send me a thousand pounds on account at once. I can't afford to wait. Noshillyshallying.'The message was unsigned. For a moment, I couldn't imagine who sent it,or what it was driving at.Then I took up the envelope. 'Viscount Southminster, 24 Park Lane North,London.'My heart gave a jump. I saw in a second that chance, or Providence, haddelivered the conspirators into my hands that day. The telegram was fromHigginson! I had opened it by accident.It was obvious what had happened. Lord Southminster must have written tohim on the result of the trial, and told him he meant to take possessionof his uncle's house immediately. Higginson had acted on that hint, andaddressed his telegram where he thought it likely Lord Southminsterwould receive it earliest. I had opened it in error, and that, too, wasfortunate, for even in dealing with such a pack of scoundrels, it wouldnever have occurred to me to violate somebody else's correspondence hadI not thought it was addressed to me. But having arrived at the truththus unintentionally, I had, of course, no scruples about making fulluse of my information.I showed the despatch at once to Lady Georgina and Mr. Hayes. Theyrecognised its importance. 'What next?' I inquired. 'Time presses. Athalf-past three Harold comes up for examination at Bow Street.'Mr. Hayes was ready with an apt expedient. 'Ring the bell for Mr.Ashurst's valet,' he said, quietly. 'The moment has now arrived when wecan begin to set these conspirators by the ears. As soon as they learnthat we know all, they will be eager to inform upon one another.'I rang the bell. 'Send up White,' I said. 'We wish to speak to him.'The valet stole up, self-accused, a timid, servile creature, rubbing hishands nervously, and suspecting mischief. He was a rat in trouble. Hehad thin brown hair, neatly brushed and plastered down, so as to make itlook still thinner, and his face was the average narrow cunning face ofthe dishonest man-servant. It had an ounce of wile in it to a pound ortwo of servility. He seemed just the sort of rogue meanly to join in anunderhand conspiracy, and then meanly to back out of it. You could readat a glance that his principle in life was to save his own bacon.[Illustration: YOU WISHED TO SEE ME, SIR?]He advanced, fumbling his hands all the time, and smiling and fawning.'You wished to see me, sir?' he murmured, in a deprecatory voice,looking sideways at Lady Georgina and me, but addressing the lawyer.'Yes, White, I wished to see you. I have a question to ask you. _Who_put the forged will in Mr. Ashurst's desk? Was it you, or some otherperson?'The question terrified him. He changed colour and gasped. But he rubbedhis hands harder than ever and affected a sickly smile. 'Oh, sir, howshould _I_ know, sir? _I_ had nothing to do with it. I suppose--it wasMr. Tillington.'Our lawyer pounced upon him like a hawk on a titmouse. 'Don'tprevaricate with me, sir,' he said, sternly. 'If you do, it may be worsefor you. This case has assumed quite another aspect. It is you and yourassociates who will be placed in the dock, not Mr. Tillington. You hadbetter speak the truth; it is your one chance, I warn you. Lie to me,and instead of calling you as a witness for our case, I shall includeyou in the indictment.'White looked down uneasily at his shoes, and cowered. 'Oh, sir, I don'tunderstand you.''Yes you do. You understand me, and you know I mean it. Wriggling isuseless; we intend to prosecute. We have unravelled this vile plot. Weknow the whole truth. Higginson and Lord Southminster forged a willbetween them----''Oh, sir, _not_ Lord Southminster! His lordship, I'm sure----'Mr. Hayes's keen eye had noted the subtle shade of distinction andadmission. But he said nothing openly. 'Well, then, Higginson forged,and Lord Southminster accepted, a false will, which purported to be Mr.Marmaduke Ashurst's. Now, follow me clearly. That will could not havebeen put into the escritoire during Mr. Ashurst's life, for there wouldhave been risk of his discovering it. It must, therefore, have been putthere afterward. The moment he was dead, you, or somebody else with yourconsent and connivance, slipped it into the escritoire; and youafterwards showed Mr. Tillington the place where you had set it or seenit set, leading him to believe it was Mr. Ashurst's will, and soinvolved him in all this trouble. Note that that was a felonious act. Weaccuse you of felony. Do you mean to confess, and give evidence on ourbehalf, or will you force me to send for a policeman to arrest you?'The cur hesitated still. 'Oh, sir,' drawing back, and fumbling his handson his breast, 'you don't mean it.'Mr. Hayes was prompt. 'Hesslegrave, go for a policeman.'That curt sentence brought the rogue on his marrow-bones at once. Heclasped his hands and debated inwardly. 'If I tell you all I know,' hesaid, at last, looking about him with an air of abject terror, as if hethought Lord Southminster or Higginson would hear him, 'will you promisenot to prosecute me?' His tone became insinuating. 'For a hundredpounds, I could find the real will for you. You'd better close with me.To-day is the last chance. As soon as his lordship comes in, he'll huntit up and destroy it.'I flourished it before him, and pointed with one hand to the brokendesk, which he had not yet observed in his craven agitation.'We do not need your aid,' I answered. 'We have found the will,ourselves. Thanks to Lady Georgina, it is safe till this minute.''And to me,' he put in, cringing, and trying after his kind, to curryfavour with the winners at the last moment. 'It's all _my_ doing, mylady! I wouldn't destroy it. His lordship offered me a hundred poundsmore to break open the back of the desk at night, while your ladyshipwas asleep, and burn the thing quietly. But I told him he might do hisown dirty work if he wanted it done. It wasn't good enough while yourladyship was here in possession. Besides, I wanted the right willpreserved, for I thought things might turn up so; and I wouldn't standby and see a gentleman like Mr. Tillington, as has always behaved wellto me, deprived of his inheritance.''Which is why you conspired with Lord Southminster to rob him of it, andto send him to prison for Higginson's crime,' I interposed calmly.'Then you confess you put the forged will there?' Mr. Hayes said,getting to business.White looked about him helplessly. He missed his headpiece, theinstigator of the plot. 'Well, it was like this, my lady,' he began,turning to Lady Georgina, and wriggling to gain time. 'You see, hislordship and Mr. Higginson----' he twirled his thumbs and tried toinvent something plausible.Lady Georgina swooped. 'No rigmarole!' she said, sharply. 'Do youconfess you put it there or do you not--reptile?' Her vehemence startledhim.'Yes, I confess I put it there,' he said at last, blinking. 'As soon asthe breath was out of Mr. Ashurst's body I put it there.' He began towhimper. 'I'm a poor man with a wife and family, sir,' he went on,'though in Mr. Ashurst's time I always kep' that quiet; and his lordshipoffered to pay me well for the job; and when you're paid well for a jobyourself, sir----'Mr. Hayes waved him off with one imperious hand. 'Sit down in the cornerthere, man, and don't move or utter another word,' he said, sternly,'until I order you. You will be in time still for me to produce at BowStreet.'Just at that moment, Lord Southminster swaggered back, accompanied by acouple of unwilling policemen. 'Oh, I say,' he cried, bursting in andstaring around him, jubilant. 'Look heah, Georgey, _are_ you goingquietly, or must I ask these coppahs to evict you?' He was wreathed insmiles now, and had evidently been fortifying himself with brandies andsoda.Lady Georgina rose in her wrath. 'Yes, I'll go if you wish it, Bertie,'she answered, with calm irony. 'I'll leave the house as soon as youlike--for the present--till we come back again with Harold and _his_policemen to evict you. This house is Harold's. Your game is played,boy.' She spoke slowly. 'We have found the other will--we havediscovered Higginson's present address in Paris--and we know from Whitehow he and you arranged this little conspiracy.'[Illustration: WELL, THIS IS A FAIR KNOCK-OUT, HE EJACULATED.]She rapped out each clause in this last accusing sentence withdeliberate effect, like so many pistol-shots. Each bullet hit home. Thepea-green young man, drawing back and staring, stroked his shadowymoustache with feeble fingers in undisguised astonishment. Then hedropped into a chair and fixed his gaze blankly on Lady Georgina. 'Well,this is a fair knock-out,' he ejaculated, fatuously disconcerted. 'Iwish Higginson was heah. I really don't quite know what to do withouthim. That fellah had squared it all up so neatly, don't yah know, that Ithought there couldn't be any sort of hitch in the proceedings.''You reckoned without Lois,' Lady Georgina said, calmly.'Ah, Miss Cayley--that's true. I mean, Mrs. Tillington. Yaas, yaas, Iknow, she's a doosid clevah person--for a woman,--now isn't she?'It was impossible to take this flabby creature seriously, even as acriminal. Lady Georgina's lips relaxed. 'Doosid clever,' she admitted,looking at me almost tenderly.'But not quite so clevah, don't yah know, as Higginson!''There you make your blooming little erraw,' Mr. Hayes burst in,adopting one of Lord Southminster's favourite witticisms--the sort ofwitticism that improves, like poetry, by frequent repetition.'Policemen, you may go into the next room and wait: this is a familyaffair; we have no immediate need of you.''Oh, certainly,' Lord Southminster echoed, much relieved. 'Very propahsentiment! Most undesirable that the constables should mix themselves upin a family mattah like this. Not the place for inferiahs!''Then why introduce them?' Lady Georgina burst out, turning on him.He smiled his fatuous smile. 'That's just what I say,' he answered. 'Whythe jooce introduce them? But don't snap my head off!'The policemen withdrew respectfully, glad to be relieved of thisunpleasant business, where they could gain no credit, and might possiblyinvolve themselves in a charge of assault. Lord Southminster rose with abenevolent grin, and looked about him pleasantly. The brandies and sodahad endowed him with irrepressible cheerfulness.'Well?' Lady Georgina murmured.'Well, I think I'll leave now, Georgey. You've trumped my ace, yah know.Nasty trick of White to go and round on a fellah. I don't like the turnthis business is taking. Seems to me, the only way I have left to getout of it is--to turn Queen's evidence.'Lady Georgina planted herself firmly against the door. 'Bertie,' shecried, 'no, you don't--not till we've got what we want out of you!'He gazed at her blandly. His face broke once more into an imbecilesmile. 'You were always a rough 'un, Georgey. Your hand did sting! Well,what do you want now? We've each played our cards, and you needn't cutup rusty over it--especially when you're winning! Hang it all, I wish Ihad Higginson heah to tackle you!''If you go to see the Treasury people, or the Solicitor-General, or thePublic Prosecutor, or whoever else it may be,' Lady Georgina said,stoutly, 'Mr. Hayes must go with you. We've trumped your ace, as yousay, and we mean to take advantage of it. And then you must trundleyourself down to Bow Street afterwards, confess the whole truth, and setHarold at liberty.''Oh, I say now, Georgey! The whole truth! the whole blooming truth!That's really what I call humiliating a fellah!''If you don't, we arrest you this minute--fourteen years' imprisonment!''Fourteen yeahs?' He wiped his forehead. 'Oh, I say. How doosiduncomfortable. I was nevah much good at doing anything by the sweat ofmy brow. I ought to have lived in the Garden of Eden. Georgey, you'rehard on a chap when he's down on his luck. It would be confounded cruelto send me to fourteen yeahs at Portland.''You would have sent my husband to it,' I broke in, angrily, confrontinghim.'What? You too, Miss Cayley?-- I mean Mrs. Tillington. Don't look at melike that. Tigahs aren't in it.'His jauntiness disarmed us. However wicked he might be, one felt itwould be ridiculous to imprison this schoolboy. A sound flogging and amonth's deprivation of wine and cigarettes was the obvious punishmentdesigned for him by nature.'You must go down to the police-court and confess this wholeconspiracy,' Lady Georgina went on after a pause, as sternly as she wasable. 'I prefer, if we can, to save the family--even you, Bertie. But Ican't any longer save the family honour-- I can only save Harold's. Youmust help me to do that; and then, you must give me your solemnpromise--in writing--to leave England for ever, and go to live in SouthAfrica.'He stroked the invisible moustache more nervously than before. Thatpenalty came home to him. 'What, leave England for evah?Newmarket--Ascot--the club--the music-halls!''Or fourteen years' imprisonment!''Georgey, you spank as hard as evah!''Decide at once, or we arrest you!'He glanced about him feebly. I could see he was longing for his lostconfederate. 'Well, I'll go,' he said at last, sobering down; 'and yoursolicitaw can trot round with me. I'll do all that you wish, though Icall it most unfriendly. Hang it all, fourteen yeahs would be so beastlyunpleasant!'We drove forthwith to the proper authorities, who, on hearing the facts,at once arranged to accept Lord Southminster and White as Queen'sevidence, neither being the actual forger. We also telegraphed to Paristo have Higginson arrested, Lord Southminster giving us up his assumedname with the utmost cheerfulness, and without one moment's compunction.Mr. Hayes was quite right: each conspirator was only too ready to savehimself by betraying his fellows. Then we drove on to Bow Street (LordSouthminster consoling himself with a cigarette on the way), just intime for Harold's case, which was to be taken, by special arrangement,at 3.30.A very few minutes sufficed to turn the tables completely on theconspirators. Harold was discharged, and a warrant was issued for thearrest of Higginson, the actual forger. He had drawn up the false willand signed it with Mr. Ashurst's name, after which he had presented itfor Lord Southminster's approval. The pea-green young man told his talewith engaging frankness. 'Bertie's a simple Simon,' Lady Georginacommented to me; 'but he's also a rogue; and Higginson saw his way tomake excellent capital of him in both capacities--first use him as acatspaw, and then blackmail him.'[Illustration: HAROLD, YOUR WIFE HAS BESTED ME.]On the steps of the police-court, as we emerged triumphant, LordSouthminster met us--still radiant as ever. He seemed wholly unaware ofthe depths of his iniquity: a fresh dose of brandy had restored hiscomposure. 'Look heah,' he said, 'Harold, your wife has bested me! Jollygood thing for you that you managed to get hold of such a clevah woman!If you hadn't, deah boy, you'd have found yourself in Queeah Street!But, I say, Lois-- I call yah Lois because you're my cousin now, yahknow--you were backing the wrong man aftah all, as I told yah. For ifyou'd backed _me_, all this wouldn't have come out; you'd have got thetin and been a countess as well, aftah the governah's dead and gone,don't yah see. You'd have landed the double event. So you'd have pulledoff a bettah thing for yourself in the end, as I said, if you'd laidyour bottom dollah on me for winnah!'Higginson is now doing fourteen years at Portland; Harold and I arehappy in the sweetest place in Gloucestershire; and Lord Southminster,blissfully unaware of the contempt with which the rest of the worldregards him, is shooting big game among his 'boys' in South Africa.Indeed, he bears so little malice that he sent us a present of a trophyof horns for our hall last winter.THE ENDTHE WINCHESTER EDITION OF THE NOVELS OF JANE AUSTEN10 Vols.

Goodman & Son, The Ph\\u0153nix Press, Taunton._PREFACE.Although the designs, which German philosophers conceived and Germanstatesmen and strategists spent thirty years in perfecting, for theconquest of our Cape territories and the creation of a Greater Germanyextending from the Mediterranean to Table Bay, are best illustrated andexposed by the defiantly defensive policy they pursued in South-WestAfrica, the rise, development and fall of the German Colonial Empire ismore completely epitomised in the chapter dealing with the Cameroons.The establishment of the German East African protectorate forms a storythat is intensely interesting, inasmuch as it reveals the duplicity ofTeutonic methods in their relations with native races, European rivalsand their own agents. Bismarck, the last barbarian of genius, repudiatedDr. Karl Peters when, equipped with private capital and acting on hisown initiative, he was acquiring in the hinterland of Zanzibar awell-watered, fertile province equal in extent to South Germany, andobtaining from the Sultan the concession for the ports of Dar-es-Salaamand Pangani. It was necessary in 1884 for Germany to assure England thatthe Imperial Government had no intention of securing possessions in aregion which was admittedly within Britain\\u2019s sphere of influence, andBismarck pursued Dr. Peters to Africa with an official intimation thatthe State would not grant him protection for the lives of his party, orfor any possessions he might acquire opposite Zanzibar. But when theintrepid Teuton, as the representative of the German East AfricaCompany, had accomplished the spade work and returned to Berlin, theGovernment continued negotiations with the Sultan through theirConsul-General at Zanzibar. The formal ratification of the treaties madein the name of the Company, was followed by a revolt of the Arabs, andwhen the Company\\u2019s representatives had been allowed to be murdered orput to flight, Bismarck was able to declare that the situation that hadarisen was beyond the control of private enterprise, and an expedition,under Major von Wissman, was accordingly despatched to East Africa tosuppress the slave traffic which still flourished in that region. Forthe furtherance of such a humane and civilising purpose, theco-operation of the British fleet was readily enlisted, and with thissupport and the energetic measures taken by von Wissman\\u2019s army ofex-British native soldiers, the disaffected populace was eventually\\u201cpacified,\\u201d even if the slave traffic was not suppressed. The Company\\u2019sclaims to the territorial concessions granted under the treaties havingbeen made good--Great Britain could not, in politeness, protest againstthe acquisition of Mount Kilimanjaro, since the amiable Kaiser hadexpressed a sentimental wish that the highest peak in Africa might bewithin the sphere of German _kultur_!--the Reichstag voted ten and ahalf million marks for the maintenance and development of these newlyacquired territories. Then, and not until then, did England realise thatwith the connivance of Downing Street and the assistance of Britishmen-of-war, this rich and important territory, with an area of 384,000square miles, had become a Protectorate of Germany. Having dupedEngland, punished the natives, and established their rule, it was onlynecessary to recall Dr. Peters and hand him over to the tender merciesof his official and political enemies, to make this chapter of thehistory of German empire building characteristic in its completeness.What Germany succeeded in doing in East Africa after years of intrigueand deceit, and the expenditure of much blood and money, sheaccomplished in the acquisition of Togoland with a minimum of cost ortrouble. Dr. Nachtigal, in the capacity of German Trade Commissioner,was sent to West Africa by his Government to enquire into and reportupon the progress of German commerce in those latitudes. He wasdespatched at a time when the English Government had completed theirleisurely deliberations upon the appeal of the peoples of Togoland andthe Cameroons to be taken under the protection of the British flag, andMr. Hewitt, a British Consul, was voyaging to the Gulf of Guinea for thepurpose of complying with the native request, when Nachtigal arrivedthere on his commercial mission. The German Commissioner, acting underinstructions from the Imperial Chancellor, hastily unfurled the flag ofthe Fatherland at Lome, in Togoland, and succeeded in reaching Duala,and formally placing the Cameroons under German rule, before Hewittarrived upon the scene. Lord Granville addressed a reproof to Bismarckfor not having divulged the nature of the errand upon which Nachtigalhad been sent, and the incident was closed. In the three decades thatfollowed, the German administrators in Togoland, with the thoroughnesswith which the Teuton is gifted, taught the natives the \\u201csharp lesson\\u201dconsidered necessary to prepare them for the reception of Germany\\u2019scivilising rule, furnished the colony with 200 miles of railway, over750 miles of excellent roads of native construction, a score of postaland telegraph stations, and a telephone system, and established awireless station--the most powerful in the world outside Europe--whichwas not only in communication with Berlin, 3,450 miles distant, but withEast Africa, the Cameroons and South-West Africa. The finalinstallations at Kamina were completed in June, 1914; in August theGerman operators learnt by wireless that Great Britain had declared waron Germany; and on 26th August the Kamina Station notified Berlin thatthe colony of Togoland, the smallest, completest, and only financiallyindependent German possession, had capitulated to an Anglo-French force.The German annexation of South-West Africa was a more intolerablyhumiliating and provocative act of aggression; it is one that onlynow--after the territory has been recovered by the brilliant campaign ofthe Union Army under General Louis Botha--can be forgiven LordGranville. Prior to 1883 the natives of Damaraland and Namaqualand,suspicious of the intentions of Germany, had petitioned to be takenunder British protection. Downing Street experienced a temporaryuneasiness, but Bismarck\\u2019s assurance that Germany had no intention ofestablishing Crown colonies in Africa, extinguished the fleetingdistrust. The Cape Colony was not so easily satisfied. A BritishCommissioner, who was appointed to confer with the native chiefs,reported favourably upon the proposal to officially confirm theauthority of the Cape Government over the region extending northwardfrom the Orange River to Portuguese Angoland. Sir Bartle Frere, theGovernor of Cape Colony, urged upon the home Government the desirabilityof the step, and the Colonial Office decided upon the formal acquisitionof the port at Walfisch Bay. Bismarck, hesitating to commit what mightbe construed as a deliberately hostile act, invited Great Britain tostate her intentions with regard to the rest of the south-westterritory, but failing to receive any definite reply, he decided uponbold if impudent measures, and in April, 1884, the Chancellor announcedthat the territory north of the Orange River was under the protection ofthe German Empire. As Bryden says, in his _History of South Africa_,\\u201cit was an unfriendly act, carried out in an unpleasant manner, and theBritish Colonists in South Africa are not soon likely to allow it topass out of remembrance.\\u201d It not only destroyed the symmetry of aBritish South Africa, and gave Germany rights in territories marchingwith British colonies, but it added 322,450 square miles of Africanterritory to the German Colonial Empire, for which a Bremen merchantnamed Luderitz parted with a hundred pounds and a score of old muskets.Germany\\u2019s method of developing her new possession in South-West Africawas entirely in keeping with her manner of acquiring it. From the firstshe proceeded to colonise on military lines. Railways were constructedwith regard to their strategic importance; they were made on what isstill called the Cape gauge; and were directed towards the Union border.A standing army was raised and compulsory service was instituted. Anartillery depot established at Windhoek, the capital, contained aworthless collection of old gun-carriages and bales of locally-collectedhay. This was to secure the colony against the imaginary evil intentionsof the inoffensive and unarmed Ovambos, who inhabit the north-eastcorner of the colony. At Keetmanshoop, some hundreds of miles furtherfrom Amboland, but within 150 miles of Cape territory, was a greatarsenal, furnished with guns and shells, rifles and cartridges,ambulances, transport vehicles, and military stores and suppliessufficient to equip and maintain an army of fifteen thousand men for twoyears. In the face of these facts and figures, we may be forgiven fordoubting the honesty of the German Colonial Secretary\\u2019s denial thatGermany ever had any intention of occupying, either permanently ortemporarily, the territory of the South African Union, and ofdisregarding the expression of Lord Haldane\\u2019s pious belief that theKaiser\\u2019s life\\u2019s purpose was \\u201cto make the world better,\\u201d and that inGermany\\u2019s method of colonial expansion, \\u201cshe was penetrating everywhereto the profit of mankind.\\u201dIn some ways the story of Germany\\u2019s annexation of the Cameroonprovinces, and her subsequent extension of that area, is the mostinteresting of all, because if she secured her footing in East Africa bysubterfuge, and in South-West Africa by the exercise of sharp practicesupplemented by a certain display of bold decision, she edged her wayinto the Gulf of Guinea by virtue of no other quality than that ofsheer bluff, but, having consolidated herself in the positions she hadthus gained in West Africa, she allowed the world to understand that shewas determined to expand her sphere of influence, if necessary, byrecourse to arms. In 1885 Germany legalised her occupation of theCameroons by placating France with an exchange of unimportantterritories, and renouncing in favour of Britain her nominal claims toSt. Lucia and to Forcados, at the mouth of the Niger River.Having thus solidified their position, and secured themselves againstwhat Passarge calls \\u201cthe intrigues and provocations of the English,\\u201d theGerman administrators proceeded to Germanize their new province andsystematically to develop its tropical resources. Although theyestablished customs houses, courts of justice and post-offices, andconstructed about 125 miles of a projected railway system of 285 miles,and, between 1898 and 1911, increased the total trade of the colony bynearly forty million marks, the colony did not prove a departmental ormaterial success. The staffs of the Experimental Institute ofAgriculture at Victoria and the Department of Agriculture at Buea,devoted their energies to the scientific raising of tropical economicplants, to experiments in plantation culture, and to the training ofyoung natives in the virtues of Teutonic industry and organisation,while, by Government Proclamation, all native children were compelled toattend the Government schools, acquire an intelligent knowledge of thelanguage and history of Germany, and practice the art of singing Germanpatriotic songs. Despite this paternal concern for the agricultural andeducational well-being of the natives, the application of German methodsproved a disappointment. The children at the end of their school courseconsidered themselves too superior to undertake manual labour, while themen, resenting the German indifference to their national feeling andinherited methods of work, developed the spirit of native unrest. A lackof sympathetic understanding of the natives was attended by culpablyinjudicious treatment of them by the German officials, and the relationsbetween the authorities and the aborigines led to the frequentemployment of the Imperial troops, while the inadequacy of means ofinternal communication rendered the progress of \\u201cone of the mostproductive countries in the world\\u201d both slow and difficult.But, disappointing and costly as was the German failure to administerand develop the Cameroons, the Teutonic lust for territory was unabated,and, in its resolve to extend its holding in this quarter of the globe,the Government did not hesitate to emperil the peace of Europe. When theGerman cruiser _Panther_ appeared at Agadir, in July, 1911, the objectof the Wilhelmstrasse was not to protect purely imaginary Germaninterests in that part of Morocco, but to maintain a menacing attitudethat would compel the French to cede to the Bully of Europe theirterritory to the south of the German Cameroons. The negotiations for thetransfer were concluded in June, 1913, and fifteen months later Frenchand British troops commenced a joint expedition to wrest from the Germanauthority, by military means, the province from which the former hadbeen ejected by diplomatic blackmail and the insistant rattle of thesword in the scabbard.It is instructive to recall the methods by which Germany acquired herAfrican possessions, if only for the partial answer it provides to thequestion as to what the Allies intend to do with them. It is absolutelycertain that however the Allies agree to dispose of the four colonies inquestion, they will never be restored to Germany, notwithstanding thefact that Herr Dernburg has committed the Emperor to the pledge that hewill never consent to make peace except on terms which include theirsurrender. Germany got into Africa as a burglar effects an entrance intoa well-stored building, but it is not because her gains were ill-gottenthat she will be deprived of them. Having experimented in thecivilisation of natives for three decades, she has revealed an utterinability to colonise for the benefit of mankind, but the hopelessfailure of the German system of imposing her rule upon subject races, isnot the reason why she will henceforth be debarred from participation inthe work of civilising the world. The colonial possessions of Germany,as well as of England, France and Belgium, form part of the stakes forwhich all Europe is in arms, and they will become the spoils of theconquerors. As the Imperial Chancellor has announced, the future of theCameroons will be decided not in West Africa, but in another theatre ofwar.Germany\\u2019s explanation of her desire to acquire colonies was based uponher need for extra territory capable of supporting her growingpopulation. For this purpose she acquired East Africa, and immediatelyset about the task of raising, equipping and drilling a large force ofblack troops. She seized the French Cameroons, and at once increased thehandful of natives which the French had found sufficient for themaintenance of order in the colony, to an army of 1,550 black and 185white troops, and she had planned the formation of additional corps ofmounted infantry, and the rearming of all the troops with modern rifles.As soon as wireless telegraphy became a practical means ofcommunication, a wireless station was installed in Togoland whichrendered the little colony of inestimable potential value from amilitary point of view, while in South-West Africa, the extent andcompleteness of her defensive and offensive preparations, is abundantproof that the real value to Germany of this territory lay in theproximity of the region to the Boer States, disaffected to GreatBritain. \\u201cThe land was not taken for _bona fide_ colonisation,\\u201d wrotethe Rev. William Greswell over thirty years ago, \\u201conly as a _pointd\\u2019appui_.\\u201d Germany pushed forward her military preparations in East,West and South Africa, as she did in Prussia, because she had convincedherself of England\\u2019s ultimate inability to hold India, Egypt and hercolonial dominions. Her professors assured the Kaiser and his junkerparasites, that the English had lost both \\u201cthe qualities of creativegenius in religion and the valour in arms of a military caste\\u201d, that wehad become \\u201ca timorous, craven nation, trusting to its fleet\\u201d; and that,while we had \\u201cfailed to impress our dominion\\u201d on the chiefs of theIndian Tributary States, the colonies were \\u201cshivering with impatienceunder the last slight remnant of the English yoke.\\u201dBecause of their arrogant attempt to put their theories and theirconclusions to the test, the German people are being stripped of alltheir overseas possessions. They have already lost their South-WestProtectorate and Togoland, and the Allies are now successfully engagedin crushing German resistance in Eastern Africa. It is not my purpose inthis little book to follow the fortunes of the Allied troops; it will betime enough to write the story of the campaigns when the task isaccomplished, and the future administrations of the colonies are inoperation. My object in the following pages is to give the public theparticulars about the Cameroons which I have collected not without theexpenditure of a considerable amount of time and trouble. A naturaldesire to ascertain the nature of the difficulties that would have to besurmounted by the allied forces, and a desire to learn something of thenatural resources and commercial potentialities of the territory thatwas about to be acquired, sent me to bookshops and libraries in searchof works that would satisfy my curiosity. I was disappointed to findthat the information I wanted was not available in English form, Englishauthors having decided, apparently, that the colony did not lend itselfto interesting or marketable compilation, and since the BritishGovernment had not accredited a Consul to the Cameroons, not even abelated Consular Report was procurable. In this extremity I turned myattention to such German publications as were obtainable in this countryand, from the official writings of Dr. Paul Rohrback, Dr. Grotefeld, Dr.Paul Preuss, Dr. Walter Busse, Herr Eltester, and Siegfreid Passarge, Igathered a mass of information concerning the geographical andgeological features, the vegetation and forestry, and the natives andnative cultivation, together with an interesting summary of the progressmade under the German system of development and the success they hadattained in their experiments in plantation cultivation. In a paperwritten by Captain W. A. Nugent, R.A., who had been a member of theBoundary Commission in 1907, and acted as British Commissionerappointed to survey and fix the boundary between the German Cameroonsand Nigeria in 1912, I found a full and admirable description of theterritory traversed. This volume contains the result of my researches,selected and arranged in such a manner as will, I trust, be foundacceptable to English readers who share my curiosity concerning thenatural resources, the commercial position and the prospects of thecolony, and who also entertain the hope that part of it, at least, willultimately form a link in the chain of British overseas dominions.

Calvert\\u2019s Map of Cameroon                                      200THE CAMEROONSDISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION.The large bay or estuary in the Gulf of Guinea, lying south of Nigeriaand facing the island of Fernando-Po, was discovered by Portuguesenavigators in the fifteenth or sixteenth century and christened the Riodos Camaroes (the River of Prawns), from the abundance of Crustacea thatinfested its waters. The name was also used to designate theneighbouring mountains, which rise to the north-west of the bay. TheEnglish usage, until the end of the nineteenth century, was to confinethe term, the Cameroons, to the mountain range, and to speak of theestuary as the Cameroon River. It was left to the acquisitive Germans toextend the use of the name in its Teutonic form--Kamerun--to the wholeProtectorate.The establishment of German trading firms and factories at variousplaces on the West African coast suggested to the Imperial Chancellorthe practicability of laying the foundations of his projected GermanColonial Empire in the Cameroon region of the Dark Continent. On March19th, 1884, Dr. Nachtigal, a former Consul at Tunis, was instructed toproceed on this civilising mission, and on July 5th and 6th he hoistedthe German flag at Bayida and Lome, in Togoland. On the 10th of thatmonth the English gunboat _Goshawk_ entered the Cameroon River, and themission\\u2019s hope of further extending the sphere of German influence onthe coast of West Africa appeared doomed to extinction. But the_Goshawk_ departed on the following day, leaving the field clear forNachtigal, who rushed through some agreements with the chiefs Deido,Bell and Akva, declared the country to be under the protection ofGermany on July 14th, and appointed Doctor Buchner Provisional Governorof the newly acquired territory. The new Governor acknowledged theprotest against German occupation, which was formally made by theBritish Consul on July 19th, and proceeded to hoist the German flag atBumbia, Maliba, and Batanga.In this nefarious and undignified manner the German Government obtaineda foothold in the Gulf of Guinea, but it still remained for them toregulate their intrusion among the nations already established in theregion. In order to solidify the position they had taken up, and, inthe phrase employed by Siegfreid Passarge, \\u201cto withstand the intriguesand provocations of the English,\\u201d who laid claims to Victoria and theRio del Rey coast, it was necessary to have the treaty of occupationconfirmed. On May 7th, 1885, a treaty was concluded by which the Britishwaived their claims in favour of Germany, who reciprocated by renouncingtheir nominal claims to Forcados, at the mouth of the Niger, and to St.Lucia. In the same year the French ceded Great Batanga and the islandwest of Kwakwa-Kriek in exchange for the German possession of Konakry.These treaties legalised the position, and Germany was left a free handto develop her possessions in the Cameroons, under the Governorship ofBaron von Goden.In July, 1911, the German cruiser _Panther_ appeared off the coast ofMorocco, at Agadir, for the alleged purpose of protecting Germaninterests, of which no trace existed in that quarter of the globe. Theincident was ultimately closed by the cession to Germany of the Frenchterritory to the south of their Cameroon colony, which was subsequentlyincorporated with it under the name of New Cameroon. The transfer wasmade in June, 1913. Under French domination, three military stations,garrisoned with a total force of four officers, twelve non-commissionedofficers, and 200 native troops, had been sufficient to preserve order,but the new rulers had their own ideas as to the military requirementsof their growing Empire. We read in _Jahrbuch \\u00fcber die DeutscherKolonien_ (1913) that the German defence force numbers 185 Europeans and1,550 natives, while it was the intention of the Government to form anadditional corps of mounted infantry, to establish a stud farm for thebreeding of troop horses, and to arm all the troops with 98\\u00b73 carbines.Since the declaration of war in August last, Togoland has capitulated tothe French and British, and the German Cameroons are now beingsystematically and successfully invaded by the allied forces. Thepolitical future of these territories is, as yet, undetermined, buthowever they may be ultimately allocated, German domination in WestAfrica, with its blundering mismanagement and bumptious militarism, is achapter of colonial history that is closed for ever.THE EXPLORATION OF THE INTERIOR.Although the commercial activities of the tribes inhabiting the AfricanMohammedan empires, and the construction of trade routes connectingSenegal with the Red Sea, had opened up the Soudan to Europeans, theterritory which since 1884 has been known as German Cameroon waspractically unexplored at the beginning of the nineteenth century. In1822 an English expedition succeeded in reaching Lake Tchad andexploring its western and southern boundaries. This discovery wassupplemented in 1851-52 by Barth and Overweg. Barth went from Kuka toYola, and discovered the upper course of the Benue. He penetratedfurther, through the country south of Lake Chad to Bagirmi. In 1854Baikie went up the Benue, as far as Djen, about fifty kilometres fromYola. Rohlf\\u2019s journey in 1865-67 and Nachtigal\\u2019s in 1869-74 are oflittle importance. In 1879 began the activity of Edward Flegel, who, onthe steamer _Henry Benn_, navigated the Benue as far as Garna. Of muchgreater importance were the explorations of the Benue district in 1882and 1883, the southern limit of which was marked by the towns ofNgaumdere, Banjo, Gaschaka, and Takum.The knowledge of the coastal district was extremely limited. Burton andMann had ascended the Cameroon mountains in 1861-62. In 1872-75 threeGerman scientists, Buchholz, Reichenow and L\\u00fcders, made importantzoological discoveries, while Rogozinsky, a Pole, in 1883, reached asfar as Lake Barombi. But all efforts to penetrate into the interior werefrustrated by the impracticable condition of the roads, theunhealthiness of the coast district--which was for the greater partuninhabited virgin forest--and by the hostile attitude of the natives.After many fruitless endeavours to explore this coastal region, anexpedition in 1888 succeeded in crossing from Batanga by way of Njongand Sanaga, and in settling the boundary between Bantio and Sudannegern.The effort to reach the Cameroon estuary was frustrated by theopposition of the Bakoko; and after a journey of much difficulty theexpedition returned to the coast. In 1899 a station was established anda foothold secured. In the same year the region north of Duala wasexplored, and the forest district traversed, the plateau of Baliland wasascended, and the grassy lands reached. With indescribable difficultythe districts from Ibi on the Benue to Yola were traversed. In 1902-4 anAnglo-German expedition, after a very minute survey, fixed the boundaryline between Yola and Lake Chad, and in 1908 an agreement was madebetween Germany and France regarding the south and east boundaries. In1907-8 the frontier between Cameroon and the Nigerias was surveyed bythe British and German representatives, and the approximate line ofdemarcation subsequently settled between the two Governments was fixedand marked by an Anglo-German commission in 1912-13.BOUNDARIES AND TOWNS.The Cameroons are bounded on the north-west by Nigeria, on thenorth-east and east by the French possessions of the Military Territoryof Chad and the Middle Congo and the French possession of Gaboon. Thefrontier runs in a north-easterly direction from near Calabar in theSouthern Provinces of Nigeria to Lake Chad, and then in a generalsouth-south-east direction to about lat. 2\\u00b0 N., from whence it strikessouth-west by west, reaching the Atlantic just south of Spanish Guinea,which is thus surrounded on the north, east and south by Germanterritory. The general outline of the country thus described is brokenin the middle east by a triangular piece of land which gives access tothe Ubangi river, an affluent of the Congo, at Singa, in lat. 3\\u00b0 40\\u00b4 N.;whilst in the south-east corner a strip of land seventy miles broadruns southwards, giving access to the Congo itself in about lat. 1\\u00b0 S.The Protectorate, with an area of 290 square miles, had in 1913 anestimated native population of 2,650,000, and a European population of1,871, of whom 1,643 were Germans.The chief towns on the coast, from north to south, are Victoria, Duala(the capital), Kribi, and Ukoko. Buea is a large town on the easternslopes of the Cameroon mountain, and Edea is on the Sanaga, about fortymiles from its mouth. In the mountainous region in the north-west areBare, Dschang, Bali, Bamenda, Wum, Esu, and Kentu; to the east of theseis Fumban, and to the west, in the low-lying country near the Nigerianborder, Ossidinge. In the western portion of the plateau are Tibati,Banyo and Tingere, and in the centre, at the junction of the main routesof the interior, is Ngaumdere. In the country north of the plateau thechief towns are Garua, an important trading centre on the Benue, Lere,Binder, Marua, Mora, Dikoa, and Kusseri. In the southern part of thecountry are Yaunde, Dume, Bertua, Gaza, Carnot, Bania, Lomie, andAkoafim. Molondu is in the extreme south-east.THE PROGRESS OF THE PROTECTORATE.In the first twenty-eight years of their occupation the Germans hadestablished courts of justice at Buea, Duala, Kribi, and Lomie, customhouses at Duala and Buea, thirty-eight post offices throughout theterritory, and had maintained order among the natives by means of twelvecompanies of Imperial troops. They had constructed and opened 108kilometres of the 1-m. gauge line of 160 kilometres from Duala to theManengu\\u00e6 Mountains, and had opened the central line from Duala toWidimange, on the Nyong River--a distance of 293 kilometres of 1-m.gauge line--as far as Edea, ninety kilometres from Duala. The importshad increased from 9,296,796 marks in 1898 to 29,317,514 marks in 1911,and their exports in the same period had risen from 4,601,620 to21,250,883 marks, a total increase in the trade of the colony of nearlythirty-seven million marks. The want of means of communication was founda hindrance in the economic development of the territory, which wasadmittedly possessed of \\u201cunlimited liabilities.\\u201d Vast tracts in theinterior were proved to be suited for cotton cultivation; oil palms,cocoa, and rubber were ascertained to be of \\u201cincalculable wealth,\\u201d andthe Cameroons were described by Dr. Grotewold as among the mostproductive countries in the world.But the administration, or the critics of the administration of theProtectorate, had discovered that the lack of proper means ofcommunication was not the only factor that retarded the progress of thisrichly endowed country. The unrest amongst the natives had revealed onthe part of the authorities the lack of that sympathetic understandingof their native subjects which makes for successful colonisation. Theirtreatment of the natives was culpably injudicious, and their mistakes indealing with them were so frequent and serious that the relationsbetween the Government and the native population were constantlystrained, and the services of the Imperial troops were in great demand.GEOGRAPHICAL AND GEOLOGICAL FEATURES.The country on the whole is mountainous and forms the north-west limitof the central African plateau. The coastland is flat alluvial countryspreading out on either side of the Cameroon Mountains, and broken upwith mangrove swamps, lagoons and deep estuaries. The Rio del Rey regionon the west of the Cameroon Mountains is a stretch of alluvial landwith a breadth of thirty to forty kilometres, which forms the extremeeastern portion of the great alluvial plain extending from the GoldCoast to the Cameroon, and attaining its greatest development in theNiger Delta. Within the alluvial the volcanic massive of the CameroonMountain rises to a height of 4,070 m., and divides the land into twoparts, which are connected only by a small and high strip of territory.To the east of the dividing mountain lies Dualaland. The other threeorographical regions which comprise the Cameroon country includes theCameroon plateau, which forms the largest and most important part of thecolony; the enormous region of Adamana, which is generally level andnowhere reaches an elevation of more than 600 metres; and the extensiveswampy lands of the Lake Chad basin which are under water during severalmonths of the year.The greater part of the colony is covered with red, loamy, sandyweatherings, which are characteristic of the tropics. If this red earthcontains hard concretions of brown iron ore, they are named \\u201cLaterit.\\u201dThese cellular-like volcanic scoria are characteristic of the surface ofthe soil generally, and especially in those districts where the loamydeposits have been washed away by heavy rains. Vegetable soil is moreabundant in the rainy regions of the south, and also in the lowlands.Indeed the result of this humid weathering is a kind of whitish yellowykaolin, or china clay, which is found in the south plateau. A blackishmould to a thickness of one or two feet covers the lowland south of LakeChad, and is there called \\u201cFirki.\\u201d Whilst in the south of the colony redand yellow clayey soil preponderates, the further north one goes to thedryer regions, reddish sand, a product of the physical weathering, is tobe found.CLIMATE.In the coast region of the Cameroons the climate is warm and moist, witha high rainfall. The temperature is not excessively high, the heat beingtempered by the cold Benguela current coming northward from the Polarregions. According to Knox (_The Climate of Africa_) February is thewarmest month and July the coolest, the maximum and minimum temperaturesbeing 89\\u00b77\\u00b0 F. and 66\\u00b0 F. respectively. The mean temperature at Victoriaand Duala is about 77\\u00b0 F. The coast is one of the most unhealthy placesin Africa, but the conditions are considerably better and more suitedto Europeans in the high-lying districts in the north. The climate ofthe latter is largely of the continental type, characterised by extremesof temperature. At Bali the mean temperature is about 64\\u00b0 F., themaximum 87\\u00b0 to 90\\u00b0 F., and the minimum 43\\u00b0 to 45\\u00b0 F. At Fort Crampel, onthe eastern side of the plateau, the maximum temperature reaches 113\\u00b0F., and the minimum 49\\u00b0 F. On the Ngaumdere plateau it is sometimes verycold, and sleet storms are not uncommon, the temperature sometimesfalling to 37\\u00b0 F.As regards rainfall, there are as a rule four more or less distinctseasons in the southern and central regions--the chief dry season at thebeginning of the year, the so-called long wet season from June toSeptember, a short dry season in October and November, and a shortperiod of great rainfall in part of November and in December--but thedivisions indicated are by no means well marked. The Adamana district,situated on the north of the plateau, lies beyond the equatorial beet,and there are consequently only two seasons, one wet and one dry.The massive of the Cameroon Mountains presents a district which issingular with regard to its climate, vegetation and animal life. At itsbase is a primeval forest, and the climate is tropical and humid.Debundja and Bibundo have practically no dry season, the rain beingcontinuous nearly the whole year round. On the east side, the rainyseason lasts for only two to three months in the year. Buea, which lieson the lower slopes of the misty region, has a fresh, cool climate, andis quite free from malaria. The temperature varies frequently, in somecases from 1\\u00b75\\u00b0 to 2\\u00b0 Cent. in the course of two or three minutes.Instead of the usual heavy tropical rains, it has only a drizzling rain,and the humidity penetrates everywhere, even the dwellings. On the upperslopes, when the north-east wind blows, it is icy cold, except atmidday. Hoar frost is frequent and snow fairly so. The mountain isnearly always cloud-capped, and it is seldom possible to obtain a reallyclear view of the summit.VEGETATION AND FORESTRY.The combination of tropical heat and rain in the alternate regions offorests and brushwood swamps produces a tropical growth of cocoa palms,cotton plants, flax and fibrous trees, and rubber vines in prodigalluxuriance and variety. The virgin forests are tropical to a height ofabout 1,000 m., when they become less dense, and the oak ferns maketheir appearance. Between 1,500 and 1,800 m. the wild coffee shrub growsabundantly, the oak ferns disappear, and are succeeded by glades andbrushwood. At an altitude of 2,200 m. the forest suddenly comes to anend and the grass land begins. Only in the ravines, in which the soil ismoist and sheltered from the winds, the forest continues to the 2,700 m.level. The high forest--the most magnificent of all tropical forestformations--is characterised by its amazing variety of entirelydifferent trees, including, among others, the great wool tree, themahogany tree, the yellow and red wood trees, the oil-palm, and rubber.Among the trees of the brushwood districts the principal are acacias andthe oil-palm, which to a height of from 700 to 900 m. covers the slopesof the Cameroon plateau to the coast.The chief planting activity appears to have been atJohann-Albrechts-H\\u00f6he, and in the Dibombari district on the NorthernRailway. A forestry plantation at Manoka, near Duala, was abandoned onaccount of its remoteness, the difficulty of water supply, and theconstant lack of labour. The principal work for the making of forestand state reserves has been conducted in Yabassi, Yaunde, Edea, andDschang. The efforts of the forest department and of private personshave been concerned mainly with: (_a_) Investigations of woods suitablefor beams, wharves, and for boat and waggon building; (_b_) trials ofwoods resistant to _teredo navalis_ for small boats; and (_c_)experimental shipments to German South-West Africa of woods serviceablefor building, mining and street paving.A large increase, amounting to 270 per cent. in the production ofbuilding and other timber, took place in 1911. The first place in theexports is held by Cameroons mahogany, which is stated to be increasinggradually in value in the market; its exports having risen in value from\\u00a37,022 in 1910 to \\u00a322,000 in 1912. The next wood in importance isCameroons ebony, the exports of which have been as follows: 1909, 672tons, worth \\u00a33,038; 1910, 1,221 tons, worth \\u00a36,090; 1911, 1,652 tons,worth \\u00a36,777; whilst in 1912 the value of the shipment was \\u00a39,055. Theincrease of exports has been largely due to an increase of cutting bythe natives, and this has entailed a considerable amount of robbery bythem. As a consequence, timber exploitation on Government lands wasentirely prohibited to natives in the period 1912-13, and concessionswere given to Europeans with much caution; a decrease in the productionwas therefore expected. A difficulty regarding the exploitation oftimber in the Cameroons is the lack of good waterways in the forestregions.CATTLE RAISING.In spite of the very great difficulties caused by the tsetse fly, muchattention has been paid to stock-breeding in the Cameroons, althoughwith the exception of certain efforts made in Kusseri, in the extremenorth, and in Garua, in Adamana, nothing in the nature of methodicalhorse-breeding by natives exists. The indigenous cattle are of twokinds, the dwarf cattle and the humped cattle. Cattle-breeding in theproper sense is only found among the Fulla tribe in Adamana, in Banyoand the Lake Chad regions. From these places there was once an activeexport of cattle to the neighbouring British and French Protectorates,but this has been diminished in recent years owing to a large exportduty. The interest in cattle-production on the part of the natives hasbeen increased in recent years, under official encouragement, in thedistricts of Dschang and Bamenda.The Fulla cattle are greatly prized in the central districts, in which,by reason of the ravages of the tsetse fly, no cattle can be bred, andwhen railway communication has cleared the infected regions, a thrivingcattle export industry to the coast will be developed. The increasedprosperity of the rubber districts of the south, especially Molondu,Dume and Lomie, has led, in recent years, to a demand for meat among thenatives, and this has been supplied from the Hausa and Fulani herds. In1911 about 20,000 head of large stock and 8,000 of small stock were sentfrom Adamana to the south, and this is estimated to mean an exchangebetween the north and the south to the value of about \\u00a3150,000.As is usual in West Africa, the natives possess neglected goats, sheepand fowls, and in some cases pigs, though this is only true to a verysmall extent in the southern districts.NATIVE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.The chief agricultural products of the Cameroons are rubber, palmkernels, cocoa and palm oil, and the Protectorate may be said, in ageneral way, to present three chief agricultural areas: the southern,with rubber in increasing production; the middle province around theCameroon river basin, with their plantations and areas rich in oilpalms; and the grass country, northward, suited specially for cattlebreeding. Nearly all the rubber exploited has been derived from thenative exploitation of wild plants. Almost all the male population ofLomie, Molondu, Dume, and Dengdeng was concerned in rubber collection in1910-11, in which years more than 1,000 coloured middlemen bought therubber from the natives and sold it to the forty-nine mercantile firmswho had no fewer than 230 stations established for its purchase. Thecomparatively small share of rubber plantations in the whole productionof the Protectorate is shown by the fact that, of a total export of5,957,516 lbs. in 1911, all except 23,912 lbs. was from wild plants;whilst in 1912 cultivated plants accounted for only 53,040 lbs. in atotal shipment of 6,184,222 lbs. The results of the attempts to inducethe natives to take up new cultivations depend on the presence orabsence in their district of wild plants that they can exploit. Whilst,for example, the inhabitants of the Lomie district, who still know ofrich stands of wild rubber plants, are hardly to be excited to commencerubber cultivation, it has been experienced in Kribi, where these donot exist, that the distribution of young plants are gratefully receivedand readily planted.It is also recorded that oil-palm cultivation has been introduced withsome success to the natives, in the districts of Lomie and Yaunde, butany \\u201ccultivation\\u201d by the natives is very simple in nature, consistingmerely in the keeping of the stands clear of \\u201cbush.\\u201d The large decreasein the exports of ivory in recent years is due in great measure to theexhaustion of the stores of ivory hoarded by the natives and the extentof elephant shooting in the past ten years. The exports in 1910 amountedto sixteen tons, valued at \\u00a3124, and although there was a slightincrease of quantity in the following year, the export in 1912 showed alarge diminution. The other native products are chiefly djair nuts, sheanuts, kola, and gum arabic, but there has been comparatively littleactivity as regards the actual cultivation of crops, because of thenatural richness of the country in products which enable the inhabitantsto buy what they require. The raising of food crops exists, however, forspecial demands, such as arise near railways, administrative stationsand larger towns, and the chief places on the caravan routes and rivers.Near such places the native raises maize, plantains, bananas, cassava,sweet potatoes and ground nuts, as well as sorghum (dura or dari) in thenorthern districts, and some kola and sesame in isolated places. Inseveral districts a certain amount of tobacco is planted; there is alsosome little fruit raising, notably in the villages of Ambam. In thehighlands of Dschang, and in other places, such as Ebelowe and Yaunde,new crops, such as the English potato, \\u201cblack bush\\u201d beans and turnips,for which the climate seems to be suited, have been introduced. Numerousinhabitants of the districts of Duala and Edea have in recent years laidout farms for the raising of cassava, plantains, maize, yams, and otherproducts.North of the watershed the principal crops are guinea-corn, millet,ground-nuts, cassava, and sweet potatoes; cotton and tobacco are alsocultivated by the Chamba pagans, Zumperis and Munchis. The corn isplanted in April at the end of the rainy season, the method ofcultivation being as follows. The ground is first cleared of weeds andthe remains of the last year\\u2019s crop. It is then prepared for sowing bydigging shallow trenches with a rough kind of hoe, the earth being piledup to form ridges between the trenches. Guinea-corn (_Sorghum vulgare_),the staple food of the country, is planted in these ridges. It grows toa great height, often fifteen to twenty feet, and is harvested inNovember. Millet is planted in the furrows; it ripens rapidly and isharvested in July. Cotton is ready for picking after December; tobaccoand cassava are cultivated during the dry season on the hillsides, thestreams being used for irrigation.From October to March, during the dry season, the natives are engaged instacking their corn into mud-walled granaries, and threshing what theyrequire for immediate use. These months are also spent in repairing thedamage done to the villages, grass being cut and tied into bundles forthatching roofs, and making new zana matting. The dry season is also thehunting season, when the long grass has been laid low by fire. Thisgrass-burning is an annual institution, although the Government hasgiven orders prohibiting it on account of the damage done to trees. Butthe hill tribes care very little for trees or grass, and a good deal formeat.As in all parts where the tsetse fly prevails, and the employment ofcattle for ploughing is impossible, the land is chiefly cultivated withthe hoe; and as the West African hoe is a tool which calls for theexercise of patience rather than skill or strength, the native leavesthe field work to his women. From this form of servitude the women willnot be emancipated until cattle are rendered immune from tsetse fly andthe hoe is supplanted by the plough.PLANTATION CULTIVATION.The Cameroons were regarded by the Germans as a plantation country ofthe highest promise, and the proximity of the Cameroon Mountain to thecoast, facilitating the realisation of the products, render this part ofthe colony an ideal area for the planter. All the largest plantationsare situated in this district, which has been extensively developed, andits products have already assumed considerable proportions in the exportstatistics of the dependency. The laying out of a plantation in Cameroonis by no means an easy task, as the fertile soil must be drawn from theprimeval forest. And as the Cameroon primeval forest has no equal forvastness and impenetrability, laborious and costly preliminary work isnecessary before any real planting can be attempted. On the whole it isvery much the same as in East Africa, with the distinction that as arule in the latter colony there is only the so-called bush to clear,while in Cameroon one has to deal with high-grown primeval forest.The cultivation of cocoa prospers on the slopes of the CameroonMountain, where the climate and soil resemble those of the adjacentIslands of St. Thomas and Fernando-Po, and its cultivation is almostconfined to the Cameroon Mountain and to some plantations in Sanaga andKampo. It is to be hoped that with the further opening up of thecountry, many districts will be found suitable for its cultivation. Inthis case the many years\\u2019 experience on the Cameroon Mountain willfacilitate the spreading. The cocoa-tree is, on an average, six to eightm. high, with a trunk diameter of about fifteen to twenty-five cm., andit begins to produce after four or five years. At harvest time the fruitmust be carefully gathered, to avoid injuring the tree. The opening ofthe fruit to obtain the seeds is done with a cane, or by beating openthe fruit on a stone. When the seeds are taken from the fruit, theyundergo the important process of fermentation. It would take too long torelate the different methods employed, but it may be mentioned that thefermentation process affects the taste and aroma of the cocoa very much,drawing away the bitterness of the bean, modifying its sharp taste, anddeveloping the aroma and the red-brown colour.A still further proceeding is the drying of the beans, which is doneeither by the heat of the sun and the fresh air on threshing floors withremovable roof, or by artificial heat in drying apparatus. Some daysafter the cocoa has been carefully dried, it is ready for exportation.It is packed in sacks or matting, and in the past it has been dispatchedprincipally to Germany to be worked up in the factories. The kernels areground and the grease when extracted is used in the form of cocoa-butterfor medicinal purposes and for the fabrication of soap. The export ofcocoa, which amounted to 2,450 tons in 1908, reached a total of 4,550tons, valued at \\u00a3212,500, in 1912.RUBBER.The attention of the rubber dealers was at first confined to certainlianas, especially the Landolphia florida, which was regarded as thegreatest rubber-yielding plant in the colonies. But in the beginning ofthe century it was discovered that the great virgin forests of SouthCameroon contained vast numbers of Kickxia-elastica trees, and thatextensive subsidiary tracts covered with the same plant existed in thesavannahs of South Adamana, in the Kumbo highlands, and the region ofLake Chad. Kickxia-elastica, known in the trade as \\u201csilk rubber,\\u201d wasfirst discovered on the West African Coast in Lagos in 1894, and byOctober of the following year the exports had reached well over amillion pounds. The eagerness of the natives to exploit this veryvaluable product led to the total destruction of the rubber-yieldingtrees, with the result that by 1906 the export had entirely ceased. Dr.Schlecter introduced the Kickxia rubber trees from Lagos into theCameroons, where he proved that 1\\u00bd lbs. of dry rubber may be obtainedfrom the six-year-old trees, a result which was more than confirmedsubsequently by Dr. O. Warburg, the well-known authority on rubber. Thefirst shipments of rubber from the Kickxia trees were obtained from thewild rubber trees known as Funtumia-elastica, and it has only beenduring the last few years that the Germans, realising that the Kickxiarubber trees are indigenous to the colony, have cultivated it, and thereare now large plantations of Kickxia in the Cameroons containingmillions of trees, which are doing well.From the tapping of wild Funtumia trees, it is known that this speciesyields latex more readily than others, and that it is almost assensitive to drastic tapping as Castilloa. Tapping of the cultivatedtree has occurred experimentally in Cameroon. These trees, however, donot stand closely-planted, but singly or in rows, and the results mustbe judged accordingly. It can be assumed that from 3 to 3\\u00be ozs. are tobe expected from six-year-old trees planted at good distances from eachother, and 1 to 2 ozs. from closely-planted trees. The method of tappingpractised in the last experiments with Funtumia differed from all othermethods, in that vertical incisions the whole length of the trunk weremade. As to its advantage over the herring-bone system, furtherobservations and a more extended series of comparative tapping trialsare first necessary. The rubber is procured by boiling the latex afterdiluting it with water; treatment with hydrofluoric acid yields a betterproduct. Although Funtumia rubber is at present inferior in quality tothat of Hevea and Ficus, and at most is equal to that of the Castilloa,still it may be confidently anticipated that with more suitablepreparation it will yield a good serviceable product.THE COST OF PRODUCTION.Most of the Kickxia plantations are laid out on land which has beencleared of jungle, a process which does not entail a heavy outlay. Theexpenses, including all costs for inspection, tools, labour, &c.,amount to about \\u00a310 per acre. A fair supply of native labour isavailable, and the average wage, including board, is about \\u00a310 perannum. The cost of the upkeep of the planted areas should not exceed30s. per acre for the first year, 22s. 6d. per acre for the second year,and 18s. 6d. and 10s. for the third and fourth years respectively. Theestimated inclusive cost of tapping the trees and delivering the producein Europe should not exceed 1s. 3d. per lb. The value of Kickxia rubber,if properly prepared, is almost equal to that of the best Para rubber,and it is certainly safe to estimate that it will always fetch within1s. of Para. These figures compare very favourably with those obtainingin other plantations, and they are given here as an indication that inits rubber exports alone the Cameroon territory has a profitable futurebefore it.In considering the question as to whether Germany will ever be in aposition to supply her own demands in rubber from her own colonies, Dr.Paul Preuss, writing in the _India Rubber Journal_, says that it dependson three factors: (1) Soil, (2) Climate, (3) Labour. \\u201cRegarding soil,\\u201dhe says, \\u201cthe Colonies of Cameroon and New Guinea alone possess severalhundred thousand acres of land suited for the cultivation of the mostvaluable rubber trees. The climate there is also very favourable. Takingthe annual requirements of Germany in rubber at 16,000 tons, thisquantity can be produced from an area of 150,000 to 170,000 acresexclusively planted with Hevea, and from 200,000 to 250,000 acres undercultivation with the various species already planted, but with Heveapredominating. Even if the demand for the raw material shouldconsiderably increase, the answer to this question would be anaffirmative as regards soil and climate; whether, however, with theaccompanying development in the cultivation of cacao, cotton, cocoa-nutand oil-palms, &c., the necessary labour will be procurable for such anextension in rubber cultivation, the question cannot be answered.\\u201d Ithas been stated that in the coming years, when the rubber plantationsare ready for tapping, and the tobacco plantations are demanding theservices of thousands of natives, the insufficiency of labour will provea serious problem, and the importation of Chinese labour was submittedto the consideration of the German Government as a feasible solution.RICE, COFFEE, COCOA, AND TOBACCO.During recent years the cultivation of rice has received more attention,especially in the experimental gardens. The forest land inhabitants havealso begun to lay out water and hill rice fields in great extent, and itis only a question of time for the Cameroons to become a rice producingcountry. But whether the negroes will ever be capable of carrying outthe troublesome cultivation of water rice, with the necessarytransplanting and careful watering, is regarded as doubtful.One can depend with greater confidence on the exportation of maize andmillet from the forest land and the drier hinterland, as soon as meansof transport are provided, as it has been found that the black can beentrusted with this cultivation. Rice, as well as maize and millet, andalso bananas and pines, which grow in great quantities, would be, asnative cultivation solely, open to question.Regarding the cultivation of coffee, the greatest hopes were raised inthe first years of occupation of the colony. The Cameroon Mountainsresemble in every respect the island of San Thom\\u00e9 and Fernando-Po,where, in 1884, a flourishing coffee cultivation existed. Nothing wasmore natural than the expectation than that a fresh impetus would begiven to coffee cultivation on the mainland, but these hopes were notfulfilled, and now scarcely any coffee plantations are to be found. Teawas planted in Buea by Deistel, and the tea-shrub developed splendidly.Plantation cocoa has borne the preponderating share of the total exportsof that product in recent years, the areas in bearing having increasedas follows: 1909, 13,328 acres; 1910, 15,290 acres; 1911, 17,560 acres;1912, 20,438 acres. The large increase of exports in 1912 is attributedto the very favourable weather in that year. It is stated that morecare, with artificial manuring, is wanted in the cultivation, and thatthe chief diseases and pests of cocoa, such as brown rot, \\u201ccockchafergrubs,\\u201d and \\u201cbark bugs,\\u201d are not under control. Nevertheless the futurefor cocoa is believed to be good.Much was expected of tobacco planting, especially in Bibundi, wheretobacco was planted at first, and the quality was excellent, althoughthe cultivation was proved to be too dear and too difficult on accountof the dampness of the climate. In 1902 there was a deficit of 200,000marks, and for some time the cultivation was discontinued. Attemptswere made in 1911 to encourage tobacco planting in the German coloniesby the guarantees of a definite price for quantities of at least 100cwts. raised and prepared in those colonies. The planted area inplantations in the Cameroons increased from fifty acres in 1911 to 383in 1912; 230 acres of the latter had yielded a crop. In view of theexpensive nature of the cultivation, it was hoped that Cameroons\\u2019 leaffor wrappers would gain a good market.The planting of the Kola-nut was undertaken very energetically, and in1904, 400 were planted in Garna, but with what result is unknown. Theexperimental cultivations in the gardens of Victoria have produced nopalpable result. The trees flourished and bore fruit, but it wasentirely consumed by worms. The natives, on the other hand, cultivatethis tree in great extent in the forest land, and especially in theKimbo highland. Among different plants, especially in the trial gardens,are the vanilla, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, and other spices. Vanilla wasquite destroyed by blight in Victoria. Pepper, cloves and cinnamon allfurnish excellent productions.PALM OIL CULTIVATION.The oil-palm in the old days was the glorious heritage of the native,who found a ready sale for such oil as his women-folk were able toextract by a slow and laborious process. It is likely that the nativebelieved that so long as he retained the tree and the fruit, histime-honoured oil business would never be taken from him, but the greatand growing demand for oil has beaten him, and he is fast losing thetrade because he can no longer make the quantity that the marketrequires. Palm oil is now requisitioned for a hundred-and-one new uses.It is no longer the monopoly of the soap-maker or the chandler. Palm oildeodorised by hydrogen is needed for the \\u201cnut butters\\u201d of thevegetarian; makers of nitro-glycerine explosives derive their glycerineconstituents more and more from palm oil; whilst the exploiters ofnovelties in metal polishes ransack the ship\\u2019s hold for leakages fromthe palm-oil cask. Oil must be had in increasing quantity; machineryspeeds up the production; yet still the cry is for more oil, until theEuropean himself attempts to become owner of thousands of trees, eagerlyand not too scrupulously encroaching on lands that once were considerednative, in the vain hope of finding a speedier road to prosperity.THE PALM TREE AND ITS PRODUCTS.The profitable carrying on of this industry depends on the demand forpalm oil and the use which can be made of the residues. That the supplyof palm kernels themselves should decline is unthinkable. The steadyincrease in their growth in all parts of the West African Coast isconclusive evidence of their almost limitless possibilities. Moreover,the statistics clearly show the extensive nature of the demand. GreatBritain and Germany are no longer the only purchasers; South Africa hasentered the market, as well as Holland and France, though their lots arecomparatively small, and could not in any way effect the profitableexploitation of kernel-crushing on a large scale.In a paper read before the Royal Colonial Institute, entitled \\u201cThe War:British and German Trade in Nigeria,\\u201d Mr. R. E. Dennett, of the ForestDepartment, Nigeria, made it abundantly evident that Germany had beenfarming the commerce of the Protectorates to the detriment of theBritisher. He showed from statistics that Germany\\u2019s export trade toNigeria greatly exceeded ours, while of the Nigerian produce which leftthe country, Germany in 1913 took nearly all the copra, half the cocoa,more than two-thirds of the palm kernels, one-eighth of the palm oil,half the hides, one-third of the mahogany, more than half theground-nuts, over a third of the shea nuts, and all the palm kernelcake.On the subject of the palm tree and its products, Mr. Dennett is bothinteresting and instructive, and in view of its inevitable increase inimportance as a British industry, the following extracts from his papermay be usefully reproduced here.\\u201cPeople who have little or no knowledge of the palm tree (_El\\u00e6isguineensis_) confuse the palm fruit with the palm kernel. The palmkernel of commerce is the seed of the palm tree. This is surrounded by ahard shell, and it is then called the palm nut. This shell is in itsturn covered by an oily fibrous matter, and is then known as the palmfruit. If we take this fruit and cut it into two parts, we can see thesethree parts of the fruit more distinctly; first the outer yellowcovering or the fibrous pericarp, from which the palm oil of commerce isextracted; then the shell, and finally the kernel, from which the whitepalm kernel oil is extracted.\\u201cThe composition of this fruit is as follows:--    Pericarp Oil        18 per cent.    Fibre and Moisture  12    \\u201c    Shell and Disk      58    \\u201c    Kernel              12    \\u201c                       ---          Total        100    \\u201c\\u201cThe uses of the palm oil tree are various. It yields the palm oil andkernels of commerce. It gives the native a drink he is very fond of,called palm wine, which, when fermented, gives our cooks yeast forbread-making. The shells of the nuts are used by blacksmiths as fuel, asthey give off great heat. At the present time there are three methods ofmaking palm oil: (_a_) from the fresh fruit, (_b_) from partiallyfermented fruit, and (_c_) from well fermented fruit.THE NATIVE AS CULTIVATOR.\\u201cBunches of fruit having been severed from the parent tree, are slicedand hammered by natives, using long poles, until the fruit becomesdetached from the bunch. The fresh fruit is either prepared at once intowhat is called soft oil, or allowed to ferment, or partially ferment,and made into hard oil. The procedure followed in making either ofthese kinds of oil is much the same. The fruit is placed either intocanoes or clay troughs, water is poured over them, and then, by treadingor beating, the fibrous matter containing the oil is separated from thenuts. The nuts are then taken out and placed in the sun to dry, whilethe fibrous matter, by further beating or treading, is made to yield theoil which floats to the surface of the water. This oil is ladled outinto pots and boiled, and then allowed to rest, so that all dirt orsediment falls to the bottom of the pot. This clean oil, soft or hard,is the palm oil of commerce. This oil is taken in calabashes or tins tothe traders\\u2019 factory, which, generally speaking, is near to a river or arailway, and there put into casks and sent to the nearest port forshipment to Europe.\\u201cThere are, practically speaking, two kinds of palm oil exported fromthe West Coast, i.e., hard and soft, but soft oil is of twoqualities--Lagos and ordinary soft oil. As a rule, Lagos and soft oil isworth \\u00a33 to \\u00a34 more than hard oil, the reason being that there is about8 per cent. more glycerine in the soft than in the hard. The percentageof glycerine varies in inverse proportion with the acidity.\\u201cIn the olden days one of the chief occupations of slaves was that ofcracking palm nuts; now this work is left to boys and women. After thenuts have been dried in the sun, they are heaped up under little shedsto protect them from the rain. In places where rocks are plentiful thenuts are taken there and cracked on them by a stone held in the hand ofthe cracker. In other places the nuts are put on a block of wood restingon the ground between the cracker\\u2019s legs and struck with a piece of ironheld in the cracker\\u2019s right hand. In this way one worker will crack from15 lbs. to 25 lbs. of kernels per day. The kernels are then packed indifferent kinds of baskets and taken to markets near rivers, where theyare bought by native middlemen. Competition is very keen, and so thesemiddlemen are tempted to adulterate the kernels by adding shells to themor by soaking them in water for two or three days. Finally, they aretaken in canoes down rivers or by rail to the European traders and soldby measurement at so much a bushel.... Think of it! 241,000 tons of palmkernels shipped to Hamburg in 1913, and nearly every nut containing onekernel is cracked by hand.\\u201dTHE FUTURE OF PALM OIL AND KERNEL INDUSTRY.Although the palm kernel industry has not attained important dimensionsin the Cameroons, there is no reason why it should not form one of thestaple products of the colony, or why the whole of the trade in palmkernels should not be transferred from Germany to this country. Hithertothe quarter of a million tons of palm kernels--valued at over\\u00a34,000,000--exported annually from British West Africa has gone toGermany, where crushing-mills and manufacturing plants have beenestablished, while considerable quantities of high-priced kernel oil, inmanufactured or unmanufactured form, have been exported from Germany toGreat Britain. About 50 per cent. of the produce of the crushed palmkernels is marketed in the form of oil, and the balance is made up intopalm kernel cake, practically the whole of which is consumed in Germany,where it commands a good price and is in great demand, especially amongdairy farmers.This profitable German industry has now been suspended owing to the war,which has rendered it necessary for planters to find a new market fortheir produce, and the opportunity seems propitious for an endeavour toestablish it in Great Britain upon a substantial scale. With a view toarousing interest in the subject in commercial and agricultural circles,Sir Owen Phillipps, K.C.M.G., Chairman of the West African section ofthe London Chamber of Commerce, has issued a timely pamphlet in whichthe present position of the trade is described and its potentialitiesare indicated. The Anglicisation of the industry, in addition topromoting Imperial commercial intercourse, and securing increasedindustrial employment in the United Kingdom, would furnish Britishfarmers--who are complaining of the enhanced prices of presentfoods--with a new supply of a relatively cheap and excellent feedingmaterial.The profitable exploitation of this crushing industry depends upon thecapacity of the British market to absorb a larger supply of palm kerneloil and upon the possibility of inducing British farmers to adopt theuse of palm kernel cake. There are at present two mills, both atLiverpool, for dealing with palm kernels, capable together of crushingannually about 70,000 tons, leaving a balance unprovided for of at least180,000 tons. To cope with this additional quantity several of the greatmilling companies of Liverpool, London, Hull, &c., have already made andare making alterations in their machinery in order to crush palmkernels, so that in the near future much greater quantities will bedealt with. A new mill on the Thames, at Erith, is also being erected,which, when completed after the war, will be capable of crushing a verylarge quantity.PALM KERNEL CAKE FOOD.In order to ascertain whether British farmers would be prepared to makea larger use of palm kernel cake, Sir Owen Phillipps placed himself incommunication with the leading agricultural authorities in all parts ofthe country--principals of agricultural colleges, experimental stations,&c., and these gentlemen have taken up the matter with the greatestenthusiasm. They are practically unanimous in asserting that the fact oflarge quantities of palm kernel cake being available at a pricecomparing favourably with that of other similar foods (now becoming moreexpensive than formerly) has only to be brought to the notice of farmersto ensure a greatly increased demand; in fact, that farmers are lookingout for a new and comparatively cheap feeding material. Many of theprincipals and professors of the colleges referred to in various partsof the country have undertaken an elaborate series of comparativeexperimental feeding tests with palm kernel and other cakes, so as todemonstrate the merits of the former. When these are completed theresults will be made widely known to the agricultural community.In an article published in the _Field_ on \\u201cPalm Kernel Cake,\\u201d Mr. F. J.Lloyd, F.I.C., points out that a really good cake, made from thisproduct, is now available in this country. The nutrients in palm kernelcake are quite exceptionally digestible, and one German authority saysthat, \\u201cowing to its pleasant taste, its great digestibility, and the wayin which cattle thrive on it, no cake fetches so high a price.\\u201d Itincreases the yield of milk, improves the quality as regards butter fat,and is said to impart a good colour to the butter, so that it isespecially valuable for winter feeding. Though mainly used in Germanyfor dairy cattle, Professor Lloyd adds that it has also been given withsatisfactory results to steers, sheep, and pigs.PALM KERNEL STATISTICS.The _Bulletin_ of the Imperial Institute contains an article callingattention to the magnitude of the trade in palm kernels, and discussingits commercial aspect.

By suitable treatment it can be separated into a liquidportion (olein) and a hard white fat (palm kernel stearin), and in thisway the consistence of the material can be varied for the preparation ofdifferent edible products. These edible palm kernel oil products areprepared on a very large scale in Germany and elsewhere, and are largelyimported into this country. With palm kernels at \\u00a317 to \\u00a318 per ton, thevalue of palm kernel oil in the United Kingdom is from \\u00a336 5s. to \\u00a33615s. per ton, with Ceylon cocoa-nut oil at \\u00a340 per ton.It is added that British oil-seed crushers who undertook to work themwould find no difficulty in getting a market for the oil amongsoap-makers and makers of edible fats. Although the article points outthat some difficulty might be experienced in finding a market quickly inthe United Kingdom for the palm kernel cake, because English farmers donot readily take up feeding stuffs which are new to them, it will begathered from what has already been said that, thanks to the initiativeof Sir Owen Phillipps, this difficulty is likely to be overcome, and theopportunity is a particularly good one now that other feeding stuffsare becoming more expensive, as that is a point which will have greatinfluence. It is not a new feeding material, but all the evidence pointssimply to the fact that it has only to become better known and availableon a large scale to result in mutual benefits to the farmer, the miller,the manufacturer, and the West African colonies.COTTON.The cultivation of fibrous plants, which have made a highly satisfactorystart in Togoland and East Africa, are to be found in Cameroon only inthe preliminary stage. In the experimental garden, Sanseveria, theRomelia-pita from Central America, manilla hemp, Musa textiles, as wellas the Uttari jute, have been planted.Cotton should have a much greater future than the so-called fibrousplant. It is cultivated at present to a great extent south of Lake Chadby the natives, and the cultivation of cotton has been calledsystematic, as only one to two year-old plants are harvested. In thatregion the conditions are so favourable that a considerable developmentof the cotton cultivation may be counted upon, as soon as morefavourable communication conditions are made. In the Benue Valley,cotton has also been cultivated for several decades. The whole of theforest and coastland are unfit for this cultivation, and it is somewhatsurprising to hear that on the uncultivated lands of the MandaraMountains, a very beautiful long fibrous cotton grows. At theinstigation of the Colonial Agricultural Committee, cotton cultivationmade a tremendous start in Togo, and in East Africa as well as in theCameroons.The export of timber has increased by leaps and bounds in recent years.While in 1909 timber to the value of only \\u00a38,500 was imported, this sumin 1912 had risen to \\u00a335,000, and, with the extension of the railwaysystem, the revenue from this source can be increased almostindefinitely.EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURAL WORK.Dr. Walter Busse, of the Imperial German Colonial Office, writing in the\\u201cBulletin of the Imperial Institute\\u201d on \\u201cThe Organisation ofExperimental Work in Agriculture in the German Colonies,\\u201d tells us thatin Cameroon, as in other parts where land is being opened up foragriculture, the conditions of settlement of the natives, the density ofthe population, the general standard of civilisation, and the capacityof the natives for any particular kind of activity, all play animportant role. \\u201cAnd in proportion as the people incline towardsagriculture, so attention must be paid to the inclinations and needs ofthe separate races, and lastly to the extent, organisation and methodsof native agriculture.... The German Colonial Government,\\u201d the Germancolonial official proceeds to explain, \\u201chas laid it down as a principlethat native agriculture in the tropical colonies should be allowed todevelop freely side by side with plantations under European control,wherever this does not interfere with higher interests. Local conditionswill decide how far in each particular region this or that method oforganising agriculture is to be preferred. But wherever climate, soiland condition of settlement do not admit of plantation culture, and anative population capable of production is present, the Government will,as a matter of course, encourage native agriculture as much as possible,and by this means create an improved economic position.\\u201dUnfortunately for the native, as Hanns Vischer points out in his articleon \\u201cNative Education in German Africa,\\u201d his national feeling, his ownindustry and aptitude for work, was entirely ignored by the Government,and \\u201chigher interests\\u201d frequently interfered to retard the developmentof native enterprise, while the Teutonic professors proved toodetermined, for the good of colonial agriculture, to transfer to it \\u201cthelong-approved system of German agriculture, which rests on a strongscientific foundation, built on the results of exact investigation andmethods.\\u201d Germany started her experimental work as soon as she enteredupon the occupation of colonies, with the establishment of gardens forraising imported economic plants, such as coffee, cocoa, rubber, &c., inthe interest of plantation culture, and for the advancement of gardeningand fruit production. When European planters commenced to take upagriculture on their own account, it was found that the experimentalwork of the botanical gardens was no longer adequate to the newrequirements. For this purpose, experimental work on a purelyagricultural basis, and an effort to effect an improvement of nativeagriculture, became necessary. To meet these demands, institutes wereestablished, and agricultural staffs were organised, and the measurestaken in Togoland in 1900, for the introduction and extension of cottoncultivation, became the standard for agricultural experimental work inthe other tropical African colonies of Cameroon and East Africa.THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.The Experimental Institute of Agriculture at Victoria remained as thecentre for the whole of the experimental work in Cameroon until the year1911, when the Imperial Government created a Department of Agricultureat Buea to deal with all questions relating to organisation, while theVictoria Institution continued to undertake the technical and scientificinvestigations. At first the agricultural work was mainly devoted toassisting the planting industry in the Cameroon Mountains, but as thecolony became opened up, fresh problems presented themselves. Thereckless exploitation of the _Funtumia elastica_ and Landolphia vines inthe rubber forests led to the establishment of a special rubberinspectorate, and various arrangements were made for the development ofall branches of native cultivation. Special small experimental gardenswere created in the larger administrative stations of the interior andplaced under the management of a European farmer or gardener, to dealwith the cultivation by natives of products suitable for export. Later,a cocoa inspectorate was established to organise native cocoacultivation in districts in which European cocoa plantations did not andwere not likely to exist, and an experimental station was founded in theJaunde district to encourage the cultivation of such crops asground-nuts, plantain and manioc, with a view to export. At Kuti andPittoa two agricultural experimental stations were established,primarily for the cultivation of cotton, but other branches ofagriculture, including stock-raising, were embraced in the programme ofwork at these stations. In 1913 the agricultural staff consisted offourteen first-grade, seven second-grade and twenty-eight third-gradeofficers.The Institute at Victoria comprised a botanic garden and botanical andchemical laboratories, and the work carried on there included theraising of tropical economic plants, experiments in plantation cultureand manuring, &c. Since 1910 young natives were trained as plantationmanagers in the agricultural school attached to the institute. At thecattle-breeding stations at Buea, Dschang and Djuttitsa (in the Dschangdistrict), and Jaunde, the breeding of Allgau bulls and cross-breedingexperiments with Allgau bulls and the indigenous humped cows werecarried on with the object of obtaining draught cattle for the severaldistricts and supplying meat and dairy produce to the Europeans. At theDschang School of Agriculture, young natives were instructed in the useof the plough and in other rational methods of agriculture. At the Kutistation, in the Bamum district, and the Pittao station, in the Adamanadistrict, the advancement of cotton cultivation is the primary study,but the programmes of work also include comparative cultivationexperiments with indigenous cereals, pulses, root-crops, and fodderplants, the use of the plough, manuring and rotation experiments,cattle-breeding and cattle-keeping, and the training of nativetravelling instructors.The Rubber Inspectorate established stations for rubber cultivation atSangmalima (Ebolowa district), Akonolinga (Jaunde district), Dume (Dumedistrict), and Djahposten (Lomie district), and the work comprised thedistribution of Funtumia and Hevea plants to the natives, thesuperintendence of new plantations, the regeneration of the stocks ofwild rubber which had become exhausted by careless exploitation, and theinstruction of the natives in the tapping of rubber trees and thepreparation and preservation of the rubber.In order to deal adequately with the agricultural questions which aroselocally in the various districts, most of the administrative stationspossessed--apart from the established experimental gardens--agriculturalofficers whose duty it was to superintend local experimental fields andgardens. Such officers were employed, among other places, at Duala,Edea, Bara, Yoko, and Bamenda, the chief aim of the experimental gardensat these places being to develop the cultivation of export products,while experiments with foreign economic plants, yielding producesuitable for export, were also conducted.MINERAL RESOURCES.The mining industry has not yet penetrated into the Cameroons, and themineral deposits of the country are commercially improved. Cretaceousand Tertiary rocks occur in the coastal area and extend northward to theNigerian border. Gneisses and schists of pre-Cambrian age, withintrusive granites, extend over wide areas in the hinterland, andvolcanic rocks of supposed Tertiary age are very abundant. Pegmatitesand quartz veins are associated with granite intrusions in thepre-Cambrian rocks. These carry tourmaline in the region north of Duala,as in the Dschang district. Quartz veins with small amounts of pyriteand arsenopyrite also occur.Tinstone, which occurs in pegmatite veins in Nigeria, may be expected tobe encountered in the Cameroons, but although prospecting has beencarried on in various parts of the region bordering on Nigeria, in thehope of finding tinstone and wolframite, no results have been obtained.The only trace of gold yet discovered was an occurrence of spangles ofgold of theoretical interest only, which was found in a dyke rock (abostoorite) on the eastern boundary of the Ossidinge district.Promising finds of mica have been made in the pegmatites of theOssidinge and Kentu districts, and galena also occurs in the cretaceoussandstone in the Ossidinge district; but hitherto no argentiferouslead-zinc ores comparable with those of Nigeria have been located.Iron ores, some of which are manganiferous, are abundant in the country.Many of these are of the lateritic type, and furnish material for nativesmelting, as in other parts of Western Africa. In some localities, ironore has been formed by the decomposition of basalt. Masses of red andbrown ores of this type are found on hill-slopes in the neighbourhoodof Bali and Bamenda. A sample of this ore was found to contain 42\\u00b725 percent. of metallic iron, 0\\u00b735 of manganese, 0\\u00b717 of phosphorus, and 12\\u00b726of silica. Richer ores of the magnetic type are found among thepro-Cambrian gneisses.Limestones are scarce and of unserviceable quality, but clays and loams,suitable for brick-making, are abundant. Indications of the presence ofpetroleum in the neighbourhood of Duala were falsified by borings.Asphal is said to occur at Ossidinge and Mamfe on the Cross River. Athin layer of coal yielding 48\\u00b73 per cent. of ash has been located atMamfe. Salt springs exist in the Ossidinge district, and the yield of asmuch as from 5 to 8 per cent. of sodium-chloride from samples of brine,is believed to indicate that salt beds may be found beneath the surfacein this district.NATIVE EDUCATION.In order to ascertain the work done by Europeans, the Government and theMissionary Societies in schools for the natives of their various Africanpossessions, the German Colonial Institute in 1911 sent out to thecolonies over 2,000 printed _questionnaires_, with a request to theauthorities to return answers according to the state of the schools onJune 1st in that year. From the information filled in and returned, HerrMissions-Inspector Schlunk, of Hamburg, was able to publish a voluminousreport on the subject, and the state of affairs thus revealed isillustrative of the best and worst features of the Teutonic colonisingsystem. The facts in themselves concerning the educational workaccomplished in the way of providing the natives with schools andteachers are remarkable.In Cameroon the first educational work among the natives was begun bythe London Baptist Mission in 1845, and in 1885, the year in which theBoard of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the UnitedStates of America entered the field, the London Baptists resigned theirorganisation to the Missions Gesellschaft, of Basel. Two years later thefirst Government School was opened in Duala, and in the following fouryears the Apostolic Vicariat Kamerun, of Limburg on the Lahn, and theGerman Baptists, of Steglitz, established schools in the colony. InCameroon, as in Togo, the Government were behind the missions in thenumber of schools and scholars, having, in 1911, only eight elementaryschools, as against the nine of the American Presbyterians, thirty-eightof the German Baptists, eighty-six of the Roman Catholic, and 275 of theBasel Mission. Altogether there were in the colony 499 elementaryschools, with forty-two European and 611 native teachers, and 32,056pupils; twenty-one higher schools, with thirty-three European and thirtynative teachers, and 1,802 pupils; eleven industrial schools, withtwenty-two European and five native teachers, and 259 pupils; or a totalof 531 schools, with ninety-seven European and 646 native teachers, and34,117 pupils. Of the teachers 3\\u00b73 per cent. and of the pupils 8\\u00b71 percent. were females.THE SCHOOL COURSE.In both Togo and Cameroon, the course of the elementary schools beganwith an infant class and lasted four or five years, the objects of theschools in both colonies having been to provide Christian instruction tonatives and to train pupils for the higher schools with a view to theirentering the service of Europeans. Instruction in German began in thefirst year, and in the third year pupils were required to read and writeGerman fluently in both characters. The curriculum for the last yearincluded the history of the German Empire since the Franco-German War of1870-71, the history of the German Emperors since January 18th, 1871,the Geography of Germany, and the singing of German patriotic songs.In the higher schools, the object of the teachers was to \\u201cimpart suchknowledge as is required in the service of Europeans,\\u201d and allinstruction was given in the German language. The schools for practicalwork trained girls for domestic work, laundry work and farming, whileboys received instruction in carpentering, cabinet-making, smiths\\u2019 work,boot-making and tailoring, printing and book-binding. At the completionof their course, all pupils were obliged to remain in the service of theGovernment for two or more years. In both Togoland and Cameroon, theGovernment had a school of agriculture, where pupils were instructed infarming, especially cotton-growing and the use of the plough, and atsome of the mission schools in the latter colony the pupils were trainedin brick-making and cocoa-planting, and the work connected withwater-supply and bridge-making.In both colonies the schools generally were open on five or six days aweek, with from twenty to thirty-five hours\\u2019 instruction per week,according to the grade of the several schools. The average length ofholidays for Mission and Government schools was from two to three monthsper annum. Unfortunately, no statement of revenue or expenditure isincluded in the case of Togoland beyond the fact that the Governmentmade a yearly grant of \\u00a3750, distributed among the various schools forthe encouragement of German language-study. In Cameroon, in 1910, theBasel Mission spent \\u00a35,386 on teachers\\u2019 salaries, and the RomanCatholics \\u00a31,626. The cost of the Government schools in that year was\\u00a31,963. Generally no school fees were paid except in some of the higherschools in Togo, where pupils paid 50s. per annum, and at Garna, inCameroon, the Government pupils paid 30s. per annum in kind.THE RESULTS OF GERMAN METHODS.In Cameroon a Government Proclamation of April 25th, 1910, made schoolattendance obligatory for all native children, instruction in Germanfrom the first class was made law, and the punishment for a child wholeft school before completing the whole course was fixed at a fine of \\u00a3210s. or a flogging. Although children generally were anxious to attendschool in order to qualify for service with Europeans, truantry appearsto have become more popular after obligatory attendance was introduced,and the native police were kept busy in bringing back absentees. Schoolchildren, who were distinguished by the wearing of brass-buttons andcockades, showed a tendency to become denationalised: few of themreturned to the family farms when they completed their school course,which had the effect of causing them to lose touch with their own tribeand families.It is impossible, after reading Herr Missions-Inspector Schlunk\\u2019sreport, to refuse admiration to the thoroughness of the German system ofinstituting these inquiries, or to the care with which the Germans laythemselves out to Teutonise their native subjects. Their organisingability, as revealed in their methods of imparting instruction to thenatives and preparing their minds for the reception of _kultur_, isamazing, but as Hanns Vischer shows in his analysis of this informativepublication, contributed to the _Journal of the African Society_, theirmethod has its disadvantages. \\u201cLittle love and scarcely any respect forthe native,\\u201d he comments, \\u201care to be found among the various reports. Nomention is ever made of the natives\\u2019 national feeling. Natives aretaught German history and the names of the German Emperors, and they cansing German patriotic songs. From every colony we hear that the boys whohave been to school seldom or never return to their own surroundings,and although this is regretted, as being detrimental to the interests ofa peasant community, no mention is made of the breaking-up of the nativefamily and the inevitable harm which must follow. The importance ofpractical instruction is everywhere recommended to teach the native towork, but no mention is made of the natives\\u2019 own industry and love forwork which might be developed.\\u201dTHE CAMEROON-NIGERIAN BOUNDARY.The country bordering on the Nigerian boundary from Yola to Obokum onthe Cross River, a distance of 360 miles, and the peoples inhabiting theseveral districts it passes through, have been admirably dealt with byCaptain W. V. Nugent, R.A. Captain Nugent, who had been a member of theCommission under Colonel Whitlock which surveyed this area between 1907and 1909, was sent out in August, 1912, to mark the boundary between theCameroon and the Nigerias along the line which had been previouslysettled approximately on the map at a conference between the British andGerman Governments. The British Commissioner and his assistants metLieut. Detzner, the German Commissioner, on October 8th, 1912, and thework of demarcation continued without interruption for six months,during which time 116 pillars were placed in position. BothCommissioners wrote accounts of this Anglo-German Frontier DemarcationExpedition, but, while Lieut. Detzner\\u2019s official article on the subject,published in _Deutsches Kolonialblatt_ (1913) is a dull, pedantic andunsatisfactory document, the paper read by Captain Nugent before theRoyal Geographical Society in March, 1914, is compact of information andextremely interesting, and it is from his descriptions that I havederived the following details and extracts.The frontier line divides the mountains, torrential streams andsparsely-inhabited areas of the Cameroons form the wide fertile plains,great navigable waterways and densely populated districts on theNigerian side of the border. The fact that Benue River and its threegreat southern tributaries, the Teraba, Donga and Katsena Rivers, allrise on the plateaux of the Central Cameroon, and only become navigablefor canoes upon entering Nigerian territory, explain the unequaldistribution of man over the country; for, while the savage pagan tribeshave withdrawn to the almost inaccessible hilltops, the more civilisedagricultural and trading peoples have kept to the well-watered plains.THE FULANI REGION.The boundary line, which commences at Byaaer, a three days\\u2019 march fromYola, crosses the M\\u2019Bulo plain and follows the Upper M\\u2019Bulo river to itssource in the Shebshi Mountains. \\u201cThe plain,\\u201d to quote from CaptainNugent\\u2019s description, \\u201cis covered with thin bush, and dotted withvillages, each with its surrounding patches of cultivation. Theformation is brown laterite, the rocks containing occasional bands andlumps of ironstone.\\u201d The lower slopes of the isolated granite hills,which rise above the general level, are covered with pagan villages.\\u201cThe people inhabiting the plains on both sides of the boundary areFulanis, subject to the Emirs of Yola and Nassarawa; but the tops ofisolated mountains, and the narrow valleys between the long spursjutting out from the Shebshi group, are inhabited by pagans, offshootsof the Chamba and Dakka tribes. The habits and customs of the Fulanisare well known--they are by nature herdsmen, just as the Hausas are borntraders and the pagans agriculturists. The country is rich in flocks andherds of cattle, sheep and goats. A large trade is also done in horses.The villages consist of round huts of sun-baked mud, with conical roofsthatched with dry grass. Sometimes, when the village is only intended tobe temporary, the walls of the huts are made of zana matting, which isalso used to enclose the compounds, or groups of huts inhabited by onefamily. Every village has its assembly place, generally under a largeshady tree, where the headman and his advisers sit all day and smoke,while the slaves work in the fields or drive the cattle to pasture.Slave-dealing is still carried on in this country, advantage being takenof the proximity of the boundary, which makes it so easy to evadejustice.... The work of marking the boundary was watched with thegreatest interest by the Fulani population. The \\u2018kings\\u2019 of all the townson the English side, and a good many from the German side, came tosalute us, generally bringing a present of a fowl or a basket of limes.Each \\u2018king\\u2019 carries a long stick, surmounted by a brass crown, theemblem of his office under the Government. There are first, second andthird class \\u2018kings\\u2019; the size of the crown varies accordingly.\\u201dThe line in crossing the Shebshi Mountains passes over the summit ofMount Dakka, upon which the boundary pillar is 5,388 feet above sealevel. \\u201cThe view from Dakka is magnificent. On all sides are tumbledmasses of mountain, much cut up by deep ravines and rocky gorges,through which the many headwaters of the M\\u2019Bulo and Kam rivers tearheadlong to the plains. On the German side, Vogel Spitz rises amidinnumerable peaks and valleys to a height of nearly 7,000 feet,overlooking some hundred square miles of still unknown country. Thenorthern spurs, projecting into the Cameroons, enclose high table-lands,extraordinarily fertile and highly cultivated.... The boundary crossesthe plateau near the only practicable pass, the road being entirely onthe German side, so that one result of the demarcation is to close thedirect trade route between M\\u2019Bulo and Kam Valleys until a new pass isdiscovered. There are plenty of tracks over these mountains, but veryfew practicable for animals. A bull which costs \\u00a31 at Tibak, in theM\\u2019Bulo Valley, is worth \\u00a33 or \\u00a34 at Gankita, in the Kam Valley, thedistance as the crow flies between these two places being no more thantwelve miles.\\u201dTHE SHEBSHI MOUNTAINEERS.\\u201cThe Shebshi Mountains are interesting from the fact that they wouldform the principal obstacle, a well-nigh insuperable one, to theconstruction of a direct line of railway from Calabar, or a point on theCross River, _via_ Takum and Bakundi, to Yola. Yola is one of the fewimportant points in Nigeria which does not appear likely to be linked upwith the coast by a railway for many years to come. The German railwayfrom Duala to the north, if it ever does reach Garua, will pass to theeast of the Shebshis, where many obstacles, almost as formidable, willhave to be overcome....\\u201cThe people inhabiting the Shebshi Mountains and their foothills areprincipally Chamba and Dakka pagans. They have many points in commonwith other hill pagans of Northern Nigeria and Adamawa. The effect ofMohammedan inroads upon these tribes is especially evident. They may bedivided into two classes: firstly, those who are slaves and minglefreely with the Fulanis, their villages being in the plain; and,secondly, those who hold themselves aloof on the hill-tops. The formerhave copied many things from the Fulanis, such as clothing, houses,&c.--almost everything, in fact, except their pastoral proclivities. Thepagan will keep goats and fowls, but he will have nothing to do withhorses and cattle.\\u201cIt is with the hill-top pagans, however, that we are principallyconcerned, as nine-tenths of the whole boundary zone are inhabited bypeople of this denomination. The first sign of the lower stage ofcivilization is the absence of clothing. A tuft of grass is the nationaldress, and even this is often dispensed with.\\u201cThe villages consist of little beehive-shaped huts of mud or grass,perched on apparently inaccessible heights, or cunningly hidden away inmazes of dense tropical vegetation. The inhabitants bear a greatresemblance to monkeys, being small in stature, but extraordinarilyactive. The steepest and most difficult ascent over rocks and ravines isto them as easy as a straight, broad, level road. In fact, I have oftennoticed that these pagans, made to carry a load on the level, areutterly at a loss. They only come down from their rocky fastnesses tocultivate their fields, or to make war on their neighbours. They arearmed with bows and poisoned arrows, from which it is never safe forthem to be parted, even when working in the fields. They are almostinvariably at war with a neighbouring village, the probable reason beingthat some of their women have been carried off. No regular trade isindulged in, but they are very fond of salt, which they obtain fromHausa traders. A bag of salt which costs half-a-crown on the coast has apurchasing power of at least ten shillings in this country.\\u201cEach village is an independent community under a chief. The inhabitantsare entirely ignorant of the world beyond the next village to their own.The nominal chief of the village has not, as a rule, as much influenceas the local ju-ju man or witch doctor, whose power over these extremelysuperstitious people is directly proportionate to his success inimposing upon their credulity. Any calamity, such as an epidemic ofsickness or a sudden death, is always attributed to the evil eye, andsome member of the community is at once suspected, and either killed orsold to passing Hausa traders. If a chief dies, the village always movesto another site. This partly accounts for the number of desertedvillages and ruins found in the Shebshi Mountains.\\u201cThe Chambas are industrious agriculturists, and keep large numbers ofgoats and fowls in their villages. The farms are generally at the footof the hills. After the harvest the people brew large supplies of spiritfrom the grain, and get drunk for several days together. These orgiesgenerally result in fighting among themselves. The principal industry,besides agriculture, is working in iron. They make their own farmimplements, spear and arrow heads, and pipe-stems.\\u201dTHE TERABA VALLEY.From Dakka the boundary line follows the Kam for about a dozen miles,and then, leaving the river, it runs over a block of hills which formthe fringe of a vast unknown tract of the Cameroon country. Here thehill-top villages are few, the inhabitants are wilder and more squalidthan the Dakka natives, and the land is the haunt of the elephant, thelion, the bush-cow and the leopard. From these hills the boundarydescends into the valley of the River Lumen, which runs for twenty orthirty miles under a dark arch of overhanging trees. The water of theLumen is very cold, even in the heat of the day, and the sands of theriver are full of iron. The line crosses the Lumen and mounts a highridge, called Shina, to descend again into the vast plain of the RiverTeraba. Along the banks of the Teraba are numerous Hausa and Jukumvillages, situated on important trade roads between Northern Nigeria andCameroon, the principal trade being in rubber, kola nuts, sheep, andgoats. There are no cattle, as many kinds of biting fly, including thetsetse, have their breeding places in this area. As the Teraba istypical of all the great southern tributaries of the Benue, thefollowing short description, which Captain Nugent gives of one of theupper reaches, will be read with interest:--\\u201cFifteen miles above Karbabi the river bends sharply at right angles,forming noisy rapids. Above the rapids the bed is rocky with deep pools.Under the tall trees along the banks are open glades like an Englishbeech wood, entirely free from undergrowth, the ground being carpetedwith soft moss. There are the feeding-grounds of huge herds ofhippopotami, who live in the pools in the daytime. The river is here 200to 300 yards wide, with high banks; the channel winds among hugeboulders, forming a chain of pools, but leaving a narrow deep waterwayamong the larger rocks. The pools are like dark mirrors, silent andstagnant, yet bright and clear, reflecting the trees on the oppositebank in full detail. Wild geese and ibis fly overhead, whilst largealligators move about like torpedoes, with their noses out of the water,leaving long trails of bubbles on the surface.\\u201cThere is no village within many miles of this place, and it was onlywith the greatest difficulty that we could obtain guides, as there areno tracks except those made by the larger game. The inhabitants of thepools were thoroughly startled at our approach. There seemed to be asort of collusion between the different birds and beasts. The shriekingibis warned the alligators asleep on the rocks in the sun, they, inalarm, slid into the water and warned the river-horse that something wasamiss; the river-horse in his turn went pounding up-stream, under water,coming up to breathe at intervals behind the rocks and branches. Thesnorting was terrific. We estimated that there were between thirty andforty hippopotami in the largest pool. I have never seen awilder-looking place; it seemed to be alive with everything excepthumanity.IN THE CANNIBAL COUNTRY.\\u201cThe boundary after crossing the Gazuba River, a tributary of theTeraba, again ascends into an unexplored continuation of the Banjohighlands, and drops into the plain of the Donga Valley. The inhabitantshere are a mixture of Jukums and Zumperis, but there are numeroussettlements of Hausas, whose trade consists of smuggling rubber and kolanuts into Nigeria without paying the German tax. The pagans, who live in\\u2018swallow-nest\\u2019 villages on the heights, cultivate guinea-corn and rootcrops, while yams, cassava and sweet potatoes grow in abundance in theinterstices between the huts. The boundary reaches the Donga, and afterfollowing the river for fifteen miles and crossing the plateau of theWanya Mountains, reaches the plain of the Bamana Valley, in which oilpalms are first encountered.\\u201cThe country between the Gamana and Katsena Rivers is inhabited byZumperi pagans, who are cannibals and live on hill-tops. They are ofsmall stature and of remarkably repulsive appearance. Every other manappeared to be suffering from goitre or elephantiasis--whether thelegacy of cannibalism, or the effect of drinking infected water, it isdifficult to say. The people are industrious, and besides corn, growlarge quantities of cotton and tobacco on the hillsides. They breed dogsfor eating purposes, and all the villages are full of yelping curs,covered with sores like their owners. In one village a large deposit ofhuman skulls was seen. The villages are well built and surrounded by mudwalls and ditches. Among the numerous \\u2018ju-jus\\u2019 found in the desertedhuts was a grotesque mask, which was apparently kept to frighten thewomen. Any woman seeing it must die at once. When the community is shortof meat, the local witch doctor puts on the mask and runs about thehills until he meets a likely looking victim, who is then killed andeaten. The Zumperis are great hunters, and have killed off nearly allthe game in their country except leopards.\\u201dMUNCHI CIVILISATION.From the Zumperi country the Commission traversed the undulating plainthat connects it with the valley of the Katsena, the last of the threegreat tributaries of the Benue, and ascending this valley reached theAgara or Misa Munchis district. The branch of the large and powerfulMunchi tribe which inhabits this area have preserved themselves fromcontamination with the neighbouring tribes, by whom they are greatlyfeared. The Munchis of the plains, who are of good physique and veryintelligent, are supposed to have come originally from a country calledPara, somewhere north of Yola, and they still call themselves Para amongthemselves. Many of their customs are similar to the Zulus, with whomthey have often been compared, and the majority of their laws areidentical with those of Leviticus. Their villages are well built andclean, and the men are brave in war and industrious in peace. Theirmarriage customs, in addition to the payment of a dowry, includeexchanges of sisters, daughters and sometimes wives. Polygamy is rife,and the value of a dowry varies from two cows in the case of a younggirl, to one cow or less in the case of a widow or elderly woman.\\u201cThe Munchis are of striking appearance. Those near the boundary arepoor and wear few clothes. They go in for extravagant hairdressing, themost popular coiffure being a shaven head with one or two balls of hairleft growing. Others wear their hair in beaded strands, falling over theside of the face. The tribal markings are a number of raised tattoomarks, in the form of a crescent, on both sides of the temple. These areuniversal, and are compulsory for both sexes, but the marks disappear inold age. Other markings are tattoed stars and rings on the forehead,chest and back, but these are all optional. The two front teeth of theupper jaw are filed into V-shape.\\u201cThe Munchis are excellent farmers, and grow guinea-corn, yams, millet,beniseed, maize, and ground-nuts in large quantities. They alsocultivate cotton, from which they weave good cloth, dyeing is withindigo, which is grown round every compound. Each village has at leastone public dye-pit. Tobacco is also grown, and is either used as snuffor smoked in large pipes with bowls of clay and stems of smelted brass.\\u201cThey are clever workers in wood and iron, making chairs and stools, inthe carving of which they display some art and much ingenuity. The ironore found locally used to be smelted in large quantities, and theremains of old workings can be seen in many places, but trade iron barsare now more generally used: from these spears and arrow-heads, hoes,knives, and daggers are constructed. The small knives are curious inshape, the handles being iron loops, which fit over the palm of thehand. The hoes have broad, heavy blades, fitted with short, crookedwooded handles, and are most effective agricultural implements. Theprincipal weapons of offence are bows and arrows, the arrows beingpoisoned with a compound of crushed and boiled strophanthus seeds,snakes\\u2019 heads, and poisonous plants, &c., which when freshly made isvery potent, the slightest scratch causing a man to die in agony intwenty minutes. The fumes from this poison, when it is being boiled, arevery deadly, even in the open air. The mixing is always done by one ofthe numerous ju-ju men, who profess to have antidotes, both external andinternal, but there is no authenticated case of a cure having been seenby any European up to date.\\u201cIn every village there is a large war-drum, constructed from ahollowed-out log, over which is stretched a hide. The Munchis are expertin the use of these drums for signalling purposes, and messages aresent in code from village to village throughout their country with greatrapidity and accuracy.\\u201cThey are very fond of dances and plays, which, accompanied by songs,are held on the occasion of the death of a chief or the headman of acompound, also at births and marriages. These dances are often kept upfor several days when the host is rich enough to supply the food anddrink, the latter being an intoxicating liquid distilled fromguinea-corn.THE GRASS LAND REGION.\\u201cLeaving the Munchis\\u2019 country, the Commission came to the junction ofthe Amiri and Mahana Rivers--whose steep banks are lined withmagnificent trees, from which hang long ribbon orchids over a series ofdeep clear pools full of large fish--in a region of open grass land. Theroad up the Amiri Valley passes through extensive yam fields and Olittiand Atcho villages, composed of roomy, massive houses in smallstone-walled compounds, protected with loop-holed thorn palisades. Grassland is reached at a height of 4,000 feet, and the path after crossingfive separate peaks of 2,000 feet reaches the main ridge about 5,000feet above sea level. To the north and east, as far as the eye can see,stretches open grass land, with range upon range of blue mountains inthe distance. Across the plain sweep parallel shining rivers,disappearing through gaps in the hills to the north. To the south andwest, the great forest-clad plain extends to the Cross River, whosevalley forty miles away is marked by a long bank of clouds. All aroundis high tableland, cut up into small plateaux by numerous ravines, downwhich countless streams tear headlong to the plains.\\u201dDescending from the main plateau, which is covered with thick shortgrass and appears to be an ideal district for cattle raising, theCommission came to the first villages of the Anyangs, who are almostinvariably at war with the grass land people. \\u201cTheir villages are hiddenaway in the forest, and consist of long, low, rectangular mud houseswith roofs of palm-leaves, on either side of a squalid street. Thepeople are very poor, and live almost entirely on plantains, their farmsbeing in small clearings, widely separated. Pigs are kept in largenumbers in the villages. Further south, the people met with are Bokis,who extend to the Cross River.... The village boundaries, although indense forest, are well known to the natives, who are extremely jealousof their rubber-collecting rights.\\u201dThe geological structure of the boundary zone, taken as a whole, is saidto present few features of interest. Traces of tin were found in some ofthe rivers flowing north from the watershed of the Cross River and Benuesystem, and nearly all the rivers crossed by the Commission containedtraces of monazite. The occasional belts of forest along the streams inthe open bush country, north of the watershed between the Benue andCross River systems, are mostly full of vine rubber (_Landolphia_). Theforest line to the south of the Benue-Cross River watershed extendswithout a break to the Cross River, and from there to the sea. The treesgrow to a great height, and the whole forest abounds in ebony, mahoganyand other valuable timbers. The rains in the boundary districts begin inMarch with a few violent tornadoes, which become more frequent and lessviolent until May, and from that month till September heavy rain fallsalmost every day. By the end of September the rivers are in full flood,and the low-lying country is under water. In October the steady rainceases, and at the end of the month the dry season sets in.NEW CAMEROON.The region of New Cameroon which was added to the German territory underthe Franco-German Agreement of November 4th, 1911, was represented asbeing swampy, depopulated, and devastated by sleeping sickness, and theTeuton acquisition was greeted with general derision. But a morethorough investigation of the possession has shown that it is not so badas it was painted, and while there are tracts that hold out no promisesof profitable development, there are districts in the New Cameroon whichwill handsomely repay exploitation. The German \\u201cfrontier\\u201d expeditioninto the interior has published descriptions of a steppe region coveredwith tall grasses, bushes, and trees interspersed with grassy plains.The country abounds with a variety of animals, including giraffes,antelopes, gazelles, buffaloes, zebras, rhinoceri, elephants, and apes,and the Lagone and its tributaries contain large quantities of fish. Itis inhabited by the Lakka tribe, a very independent race of Sudannegroes, who live in villages and disclose many differences inlanguages, manners, and customs. Hunting and fishing are their secondaryoccupation, but their regular occupation is agriculture. Theirwell-tilled fields, fertilised with the ashes of burnt grass, producemillet, ground-nuts, tobacco, hemp, and cotton, and their greatestdelicacies are dried fish and caterpillars. They possess a few horsesand goats, and the women employ themselves in pottery and basket workwhen not engaged in agriculture. Herr Eltester says that the Pangwetribe, inhabiting the Muni district, are distinguished by everyconceivable bad quality. They are thieves, liars, and idlers, and aregiven to indolence. The men sit around in the villages and smoke, theboys lay traps for wild animals, and the women till the fields.THE DIFFICULTIES OF DEVELOPMENT.The greatest drawback to the systematic development of the Cameroons isthe naturally bad means of communication as regards both roads andwaterways. The country being largely of steppe-like formation, therivers are frequently interrupted by rapids and waterfalls. The chiefrivers, the Munga, Wuri, and Sanaga, are only navigable by steamers fora distance of seventy kilometres. Beyond this point, litter-transporthas to be employed, and as bearers can only carry loads of 60 to 70 lbs.for a distance of from twenty to twenty-five kilometres a day, and asthe distance from Duala, the coast station, to Central Cameroon is athirty days\\u2019 journey, and to Lake Chad twenty days\\u2019, few products,except ivory and rubber, can bear this expensive means of transport. Themost important tasks before the Government which is entrusted with thefuture of the Cameroons is the amplification of the means ofcommunication, the encouragement of native civilisation, theexploitation of the economic resources of the valuable hinterland, andthe extension of the plantation system. The enormous physicaldifficulties in the way of railway construction must not beunder-estimated. The country is covered with colossal tropical growths,which must be cleared, the plague of sleeping-sickness must be stampedout, and the dreaded tsetse fly banished. In such regions railwaybuilding is arduous and costly, but not until the rich regions hithertounreached have been brought into communication with the coast, will theCameroons begin to profit by its \\u201cunlimited possibilities.\\u201d[Illustration: PLATE 1DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 2.THE QUAY AT DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 3.LANDING-PLACE AT DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 4.POST OFFICE, DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 5.COURT HOUSE AT DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 6.HOSPITAL AT DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 7.NATIVES\\u2019 METAL WORK.][Illustration: PLATE 8.THE B\\u00c2LE MISSION AT DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 9.WORKSHOP OF THE B\\u00c2LE MISSION, DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 10.MANGA BELI\\u2019S PALACE, DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 11.THE NATIVE QUARTER, DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 12.BUSINESS OFFICES IN DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 13.NATIVES WOOD CARVING.][Illustration: PLATE 14.THE WOERMANN FLOATING DOCK AT DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 15.LANDING JETTY.][Illustration: PLATE 16.CONSTRUCTING THE CENTRAL RAILWAY FROM DUALA TO THE NYONG RIVER.][Illustration: PLATE 17.VIEW OF THE WURI RIVER AT BONABERI.][Illustration: PLATE 18.THE WURI RIVER ABOVE DUALA.][Illustration: PLATE 19.ELEPHANT GRASS.][Illustration: PLATE 20.BUEA, FORMER SEAT OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT OF CAMEROON.
